      "Living in such a culturally diverse state as California, paradoxes are ubiquitous. Diversity breeds paradoxes. The paradox that has been most prevalent in my life has been my parents' relationship and its enduring nature. \\\\At its basic level, my parents' relationship is a beautiful love story. My father was born in Tehran, Iran and was raised as a devout Muslim. Attending Islamic schools, he enrolled in the Iranian military to fight a religious war against Iraq during the 1980's. In contrast, my mother was born in a very impoverished community in East Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants. Raised with Catholic teachings, she once entertained the thought of becoming a nun in order to fulfill her religious duties. \\\\Indeed, my parents grew up in entirely different cultures, but as the old adage goes, opposites attract. Thankfully for me, the environment my parents cultivated has instilled within me a holistic, rich, and vibrant perspective. Specifically, my family's background has enhanced my cultural awareness and ability to accept others. My upbringing has not always been easy; my Iranian side of the family are devout Muslims and have very stringent standards for female behavior. Women are forbidden to dance, but dance is my passion. Women are not encouraged to pursue education, but I thrive in the academic sphere. Women are obedient, but I had the iron-clad will of my fierce Mexican mother. Women are not supposed to lead, but I shined in my role as a leader, winning president for ASB, junior, and sophomore class.\\\\That said, the tug-of-war within my identity had its fair share of challenges, challenges that I eventually overcame with a better and stronger sense of identity.  And although there have been these challenges, my cultural background is incredibly vibrant: I've celebrated Persian New Year and Cinco de Mayo, I've eaten Koobideh and tamales, and I've sipped on Chai and Horchata. Apart from this gastronomical adventure, I've developed a significant cultural awareness that has fostered my thirst to learn about different cultures and people. \\\\Such awareness was amplified when I was invited to join the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHHS), which has allowed me to gain valuable insight into different cultures and experiences. The NSHHS hosts global conferences. By attending these conferences, I've interacted with people from various continents. Through such interactions, I have learned compassion and how to work collaboratively with others. Because I'm interested in pursuing a career in government and politics, these conferences have furthered my desire to understand the inner-workings of government. I've met and conversed with eminent figures such as Al Gore and Condoleezza Rice, and have also had the privilege of attending both of President Obama's inaugurations. From these conferences, I've gained a deep knowledge of how governmental systems operate. More importantly, I gained a desire to study political science and focus on international affairs. \\\\I am drawn to the study of political science because public policy and government shape society. Whether it be the rate of taxes or international affairs, politics is rooted in and impactful to almost every aspect of life. Even when I volunteered to canvass for an incumbent campaigning for the Water Board District, I felt as though I was making an impact, albeit a small one.  I want to play an active role in forming public policy and in shaping society; I hope to bring passionate, logic-based ideas to the forefront of global politics. Furthermore, immersing myself in political science would give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of government and policy on both national and international levels. \\\\My desire to pursue political science taught me that while my Iranian-Mexican background has brought many trials, it has ultimately taught me important life lessons. It has challenged my beliefs and self-identity and instilled in me a fire. This fire drives me to learn, to explore, to be more than an Iranian-Mexican. It is a fire that will light the pathway for further intellectual growth and world discovery as an advocate and scholar within the realm of political science.  It is this fire that will inspire me to become a true agent of change.\n",

      "Since kindergarten, I have attended The American School in Japan (ASIJ), which serves the international community in Tokyo.  And since I was two years old, I have lived in Japan, a country with a very distinctive culture and a dense social fabric.  By living simultaneously in these two different worlds, I have come to see the value of interacting with the world globally, with a positive and receptive outlook, and engaging in a deep and meaningful way in the local environment.  To me this is a very interesting and fulfilling way to live, and I plan to continue this way of life through a career in international business with a focus on Asia.\\\\ASIJ is American in many respects - for example, in terms of its curriculum and sports teams - but its basic orientation is global.  Our students and teachers come from over 38 countries, including from Europe, South America and throughout Asia.  Although the students typically speak English among themselves, there is no dominant national culture - students arrive at ASIJ from all over and fit in quickly.\\\\In addition to the diverse environment on campus, my school activities and studies bring me regularly in contact with the broader world.  In cross-country and track, I have competed in pan-Asian meets with runners from across the region, and I have travelled twice to Thailand with a school group to work with a local NGO there in support of rural development.  In the summers, I have studied Chinese intensively in Taiwan and Shanghai, staying with a local host family in Shanghai.  \\\\As a result of all this, it is very natural for me to see the world as a comfortable and accessible place.  I believe that my background, experience and language skills will help me prosper in the increasingly global world - where immigration into developed countries and cross-cultural contacts are becoming more and more common, and businesses must achieve success on an international scale.\\\\At the same time - because I have lived in Tokyo continuously for more than 16 years, and am native fluent in Japanese - I have engaged in a deep way in the local Japanese community.  For example, I attended a Japanese public elementary school for five summers; I played basketball on Japanese club teams for over five years; and I am currently running on a Japanese track club, organized and led by former runners at the national level.  In addition, this summer I worked a variety of part-time jobs on the local economy, through a Japanese employment service.  \\\\Through these experiences, I have made close connections with many Japanese people, and have developed some understanding and respect for how Japan works, and how to live and engage successfully in this unique and fascinating country.  My experience in living in Japan has given me insights into success in international business as well.  To succeed outside its national borders, a business needs more than just global scope - it must have close and sustained connections with the local communities where it operates.  \\\\This interplay of global and local fascinates me.  I believe that businesses and societies must be oriented in both ways to achieve success in the coming decades - competing with the very best on an international basis, while focusing on and serving local needs and requirements.  I am very fortunate to have lived globally and locally in my life to date, and this is how I want to live going forward, as a business person and more broadly - being part of the local community wherever I am, while connecting with people on a global basis.\n",

      "\"Bringing art to kids in need.\" This is not only the mission statement of the non-profit 1KID, but also a cause I highly support.  At 1KID, we believe it is important to supplement under-funded schools in developing countries with art in order to provide a creative outlet for impoverished kids. My experience developing 1KID, my education, and my international experience have inspired me to become a successful businesswoman and continue advocating for improved education in third-world countries.  I hope to always travel around the world to have first-hand experiences with new cultures and be in a diverse work environment in order to achieve my dream.\\\\To begin with, developing 1KID, a non-profit which has raised over $10,000 to provide supplies to under-funded schools around the globe, has greatly influenced my goal to be a businesswomen and support education. As a member on the development committee, I learned to voice my opinions and make compromises with others. We had one especially large event, our second art show which featured local student and professional art.  Being treasurer, I managed the finances of the fundraiser as well as helped execute it.  We traveled the city requesting donations of professional art, and we decided how to advertise the event.  Surprisingly, I absolutely loved working together and leading a great team to execute the grand vision we all held. Times like these confirmed business as my desired career.  1KID was my chance for me to make a positive difference through a seminal idea that we implemented and set in action.  A business degree will allow me to keep supporting the same cause of education on a larger scale, so that I can continue to have a positive impact.\\\\Starting my own business requires me to be a visionary and to be determined to make my goals a reality. Luckily, these are qualities I found in myself through my world at school, which has influenced me to always want a challenging education and has taught me to work hard towards my goal.  The advanced classes I have taken presented challenges that made me an independent learner, dedicated to my aim of mastering the subject. For example, when my Pre-calculus class became challenging, I had to teach myself many of the concepts and find the solutions to the problems.  Often times, I would sit with my textbook and notes to work through problems and grasp a concept I couldn't understand.  I immediately noticed the results of my independent motivation, and I hope to diligently move towards my goals in order to achieve my dream of starting my own business. \\\\In addition to having my business, I have always dreamt of travelling the world. Specifically, travelling will be a way for me to immerse myself in different cultures and be able to explore new places.  My family and our love to travel has been a huge influence on this passion.  Every year, we travel locally, as well as internationally, which has accentuated my interest in foreign countries. Two years ago, we visited Germany, where I witnessed a lot of the history about the Holocaust.  On my trip to the Caribbean last summer, I observed the lifestyle of those living on the islands. Moreover, my family frequently travels to India to visit family. It is on these vacations that I witnessed the most lack of education: my motivation to help develop 1KID.  Vacations like these allowed me to become more cognizant about different places, and I plan to always continue learning this way. International experience will be a vital part of my career; it will allow me to become a global businesswoman.  \\\\Overall, my extremely resourceful world has influenced me to aim high and achieve great things. However, it has also made sure I do not forget about those who are less fortunate. I aspire to have a career in business where I can have diverse experiences and positively impact the world.\n",

When I was in high school, I served as JSA's Southern California Lieutenant Governor because I was passionate about inspiring my classmates not only to vote for me in school elections, but to vote for actual politicians.\" As I sat in the large and imposing chamber of the US House of Representatives last July, listening to Congressman Mark Takano recount his beginnings in politics, I took a moment to reflect back on mine.\\\\A single quotation on the board at the beginning of my sophomore AP US History course first sparked my interest in American politics: \"Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves, and the only way they could do this is by not voting.\" After our class discussed Franklin Roosevelt's statement, we determined that that is exactly the issue in the world of American politics today: people aren't voting. By not participating in politics, people allow our government to make decisions that may serve a select minority, rather than the majority. To improve our political system, the majority of us, especially young people, need to be involved. As someone who comes from a religious minority, Zoroastrianism, and as someone whose family has faced significant oppression in Iran, I've long understood how important it is for a government to reflect its people's interests. With this class, however, I began understanding just how significant the problem of political apathy in America is, so I joined our school's Junior State of America (JSA) chapter.\\\\As JSA's Director of Activism for my school, I've focused heavily on increasing political participation through mock government elections and voter registration drives. As the 2014 California elections approached, we observed and discussed the gubernatorial candidates, their policies, and the state propositions. Watching my friends' faces light up as they actively debated policies--policies that would affect the very world they live in--was inspiring. Having learned about politics outside the classroom setting, they seemed so much more interested, and I felt more encouraged to get students involved in the political process. When they consequently registered to vote so they could translate their opinions to real-world polls, I knew I had impacted not only the political system but my friends' lives, as well.\\\\In an attempt to reach a wider audience, I coupled local activism with increased support for JSA as an organization. Since being elected Southern California Lieutenant Governor at the end of my junior year, my goal has been to increase the total number of students able to attend conventions. By spearheading expansion efforts in the Southern California JSA and increasing the total number of chapters to 116--the largest number of chapters nationwide--I've helped more students attend conventions, debate, and discuss political issues. Being able to bring political activism to students from schools across California by working at a broader administrative level has been just as rewarding as, if not more rewarding than, working with students individually at the local level.\\\\And now, here I am, on another JSA exploit, listening to Congressman Takano and having a former JSA member encourage me for a change. Listening to his beginnings, when he held the same position in JSA that I currently hold, inspires me to look to the next level of the political process: the national level. To further combat political apathy, I hope to one day run for political office to become more personally involved in the political process. As an active member of establishment politics, I would hope to effect change within government and lead national initiatives to promote political participation, taking further steps to address the perpetual problem of political apathy.\n",

      "I became very involved with the North American Federation of Temple Youth (NFTY) in order to connect more closely with my Jewish heritage. NFTY has influenced both my intellectual and spiritual growth. As an elected youth group leader at my home congregation, I was fortunate enough to participate in two summers at the Kutz Leadership Institute in New York. This opportunity allowed me to network with other teen leaders from across the country and exchange strategies to implement change in our local youth programs and educational activities. \\\\My time at Kutz inspired me to submit a new constitution for my local temple youth group. This undertaking was welcomed by both the teen membership and adult leadership and clergy since no review of our governing documents had taken place in over 20 years. In collaboration with a few of my peers in other cities, I have also helped to write an amendment for my NFTY regional constitution about allocation of voting rights among different chapters. Writing these official legislative documents reinforced how much I enjoy implementing necessary changes to improve the status quo. \\\\NFTY has also helped me to grow as a leader in many other capacities. It allowed me to develop the communication skills to reach out to people and interact with adult leaders. During my three years as a member of my temple youth group board in the positions of Membership VP, Programming VP, and currently President, I have learned to effectively deal with the different dynamics of each year's board. As President, I delegate authority while at the same time build consensus with those who may have strong opinions that differ from mine. \\Since pre-K, I have attended an Episcopalian school where Jewish students were in the minority. While the school embodies a tolerant and inclusive atmosphere, as I entered high school it became increasingly apparent to me that many of my classmates were unaware of Jewish traditions. As a result, in my junior year I submitted an application and was granted approval to start the Jewish Culture club. As President of the organization over the last two years, I have led the club's efforts to share information about Jewish culture, food, and history, which has helped promote understanding among a diverse group of students. \\\\My experience with NFTY and the Jewish Culture club has helped shape my interest in studying political science, public policy, and their relationship with economics. This interest has inspired me to participate in a Global Scholars program that my high school offers. Students who enroll in this program are required to take extra courses relating to global affairs and complete a capstone project on a global issue by the end of senior year (mine is about the multiple impacts of human trafficking in the Tampa Bay area). Watching the recent presidential debates and the news coverage of the different candidates has also piqued my interest in foreign affairs. While a career in government may not typically be what a high school student aspires to pursue, my \"dream\" would be to become Secretary of State where I would have the opportunity to influence all matters of international relations. An education in political science and economics will help me gain insight and entrance into this field.\n",

      "Growing up I was one of the happiest kids ever. I was always outside, playing with my sisters, and friends, enjoying life like every normal kid. Never did anyone see me unhappy. At the time I was seven years old, my older sister ten, and my youngest sister was four, we had both our parents living in the same house and life was great. As time went on, two of my cousins  moved in  with us, they gained all of our trust, and things were great for a while. One day my dad was running late to go pick up my younger sister Isabel from daycare and I wasn't ready so I asked if it was ok for me to stay with my cousin. My dad was hesitant about it but my cousin assured him that I'd be fine, so my dad let me stay. From that day forward my life changed forever. I was molested and threatened, by my cousin who was like a brother to me. I was told that if I ever told anyone about the things that went on,  my parents and sisters would be killed in front of me. At the time I didn't know exactly what was going on, but I knew what he was doing wasn't okay because it didn't feel right.  My mom would always tell me that if anything was going on to let her know, that no one should ever touch my body parts. I lived in fear that my parents and sisters would be taken away from me. He later moved out, and finally those horrific days were over, but I kept my secret with me for seven years. \\\\Life went on, but as time went on I became one of the angriest girls ever. I couldn't stand being hugged, touched, kissed, and rarely trusted anyone in my life. Anger continued to build up in me every single day and at one point I started to blame everyone and hated the world for what had happened to me. All I wanted was to have my childhood back and  to have good memories  but that wasn't going to happen. I later on reached out for help and got counseling and overcame all my obstacles with the help of my family, counselor and SOFTBALL.\\I joined a nearby softball travel team and let all my frustration and anger out on the field, and as soon as I stepped off the field I felt so much better. I played for a good two years and then I faced yet the BIGGEST obstacle in my life. During a game i had a bad play and injured my knee. This injury cost me many benched games, endless doctor's appointments to Valley Children's Hospital, and finally in the summer of 2014 I had my first knee surgery it was not successful.  Six months later I'd be having a second knee surgery, a surgery that would make me experience pain at a whole new level. I had what I believe is called a lateral detach,which is a surgery where your leg bone is cut shorter to make your kneecap rotate properly. The first words out of my mouth after surgery were\" I feel like I've been run over by a bus\"  alI I wanted to do was sleep and was not allowed to because of the reaction my body was having to the anesthesia and pain medication. It was causing my blood pressure to drop drastically and I was at risk of my heart stopping. Two days after surgery I was finally able to go home, but that's when my new  hell began. The pain was so severe I could not tolerate anyone touching my leg, and I couldn't even get up out of bed . Two weeks after surgery I returned to children's hospital for a checkup, and doctors could not understand why the pain medication I was on was not working. That is until they took my bandages off, my leg had severely bruised especially on my calf. Just to make sure everything was ok my doctor ordered an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot . Meanwhile all this is going on I was told I had to stay off my leg for another 6 weeks, I felt like I had  hit a brick wall. All I could think of was another season without softball, 6 more weeks of feeling useless not being able to bath myself, or even put on my own clothes I went home devastated.  Two months  after surgery I was finally able to get my cast removed and could start bending my knee again, I felt like the world was lifted off my shoulders. Now half a year later, 2 surgery, and endless drives to Valley children's every week for physical therapy, I have once again set foot on the softball field. That softball field that I love so much and has helped me overcome my childhood nightmare.\n",

      "My mom is guatemalan and my dad is salvadorian. They both raise me for well mangers and showing respect and fairness to others. Both of my parents are strict they aspect a lot from me. I'm always under pressure fro them. I'm the only child from my mom side. My dad has three other daughters from his ex wife. People knows me as a happy child, that enjoys making people smile and laugh and also always there for a person when it comes to problems. But in reality in my life  I never been happy. There was moment that I was but it never last. When I was little until the age four my dad came into my life he wasn't really around when I was smaller. I always seen him as a stranger but I gain my love for him little by little. At the age 6, he had an addiction to alcohol that's when things began to change. He began to beat my mother for the littlest things. There was times I would try to stop him and protect my mom but it was us less, he will beat be for protecting her then finish her until he was over the problem. Every moment was the same, I tired to keep a smile on my face to no one can know what's going on at home. There was a time I won't forget. It was late at night I was 7 years old I was watching Care Bears and my mom was in the living room then my dad came drunk as hell. I no longer remember what the argument was about but what I remember was yelling and screaming and my mom was yelling my name. I ran to the kitchen my dad was holding her from her neck and threating her with the knife I tired to stop him but he just hit me and told me to go to my room. And some how he was able to come down and just watch television. Since that day i always had love and hate for both my parents. Reason for my mom had suffer a lot from my dad but yet she continues to stay with him and my dad cause he was an ass whole to my mom and she always forgive him from his mistakes. In 2009 my dad became silver. Him and my mom decided to get marry and apologizes to her how he miss treated her throughout the years and of course my mom forgive him. Little by little my actions we're changing. My parents we're always arguing with me cause of my behavior was no longer the same. I told them how all the abuse affected me but they kept saying that I was stupid that it was in the past. In middle school I began to do drugs and thought there was no point for education. My relationship with my mom was no longer the same she was always in my back and I hated that. We tried going to counseling so we can have a better communication. It only help for about a week oh so then it was back the the arguments. Once it came to high school I change my actions and wanted a futures for myself. I tried my best to get good grades some times my parents thought I wasn't trying my best and then the arguments continues. Since I was getting older my arguments and fights we're mostly towards my dad. There was times he would compare b=me with his older daughter and which I hated to be compared with others. Then the arguments was leading to fights. He didn't like that fact how I was able to protect myself so he will beat me and I fight back. Just recently in October we got in a big fight he busted my lip and hit me several times in the head. I told my friends about and they suggested me to tell my counselor about it and I did. She never expected this was occurring in my life and I told the officer that works at my school and he ask me if i felt safe about it I said no, so he took me to the police station and called the social worker about it. She talk to me and then my parents and came to can conclusion my dad should leave the house until to be return. They decided not to take it to court cause I'm almost 18  and they wanted him to take anger management class which he has to wait to know when to go. He has return and we don't longer speak each other until I'm ready. I want to continue my education and have a major in Criminal Justice and be the first in the family to be in the FBI. Receiving the help can help me achieve my goal and soon help my family no matter what. And show them I made it\n",

      "I am wiser than many teens my age.  I am a young African American woman who has experienced many obstacles but did not and will not allow them to prevent me from rising to the top.  At the age of two, my twin and I were placed in foster care because our biological mother had too many children and unable to care for us.  We were placed in a couple of homes before we were placed in a home of a kind young couple.  They loved us unconditionally and decided to adopt us.  My life was changing for the better, but it still was not perfect.  \\At the age of six, my adopted parents divorced each other. There was no explanation given, it just happened. I remember being at my mom's in Antioch, waiting for my dad to come home. \"Mom, where is Daddy\", I asked her for the fifth time. She kept telling me that he wasn't coming home. I grabbed my favorite barbie blanket and pillow and went downstairs and waited by the door for my dad. My mom kept calling me upstairs to go to sleep, but I didn't listen to her. I just wanted my dad to come home. Since I wasn't listening to my mom, she called my aunt and my aunt told me that my dad wasn't coming home. I was crying and screaming for hours until I fell asleep by the front door. When I woke up the next morning, I was in my room and my dad still wasn't there. That's when my mom explained to me what was going on between them.\\Years went by and those were very tough years. They were tough because there was many transitions. We had to get used to our parents dating other people and living in different houses. I stopped wishing for my parents to get back together because I knew it was never going to happen, however, I still wasn't comfortable with my dad dating. I wasn't comfortable with him dating because I was used to having both of my parents together. Since my dad was moving on, my mom was too. My dad got married in 2007 and now we had a step sister and later on a little brother.\\My mom ended up moving to Brentwood for a couple of years and then moved to Modesto. I will never forget the house in Modesto. I will never forget it because on my10th birthday my mom told us that we were adopted. Now, I've always heard people saying that we were, but I didn't believe it. When my mom told us she started crying because she thought we would have been mad at her. I wasn't mad at her because she didn't do anything wrong, I was just disappointed and sad. Then I began thinking that everything was happening to me because I was adopted. Prior to those years, my dad kicked me out of his house because my stepmom said \"It's either me or her\". So surprisingly, he chose her. So for a month and half I stayed with my mom and I wasn't able to see my dad and I used to cry my eyes out all the time.\\    I was also disappointed and sad because my biological parents didn't want my brother and I for some reason. My mom told me that we had a lot more siblings that stayed with our biological grandma, but yet I wondered why we couldn't be with our biological grandma? Ever since I was told that my brother and I were adopted, I questioned a lot of things. I questioned myself, my parents, and my family. This was and still is to this day a very sensitive topic. I've always felt like my parents have had favoritism toward all my other siblings including my twin brother. I've had family members say to me \"I wish your dad never adopted you\" or \"Your dad should just take you guys back\". For some reason I would never cry when I heard those type of comments. I just let it go.\\    However, those comments and everything that has happened has made me into a very strong young women.  Even though I am very guarded and I don't show emotion, I don't let the negative comments get in my head because I am better than that. I repeatedly remember that \" I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\" (Philippians 4:13). I am ready to go to college and just become a happier person and learn a lot more. I've also learned that being adopted won't stop me from doing anything. If anything, I want to go to college, get a degree in psychology or criminal justice, graduate with my bachelor's, and then go find my family.\n",

      "Living through a Disease\\When I was five years old, my mother had been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer; she had surgery but it continuously reappeared until she got a double mastectomy when I was nine. I was jubilant that my mother was cancer free, I no longer had to watch her cope with the pain, and she was miraculously healthy again. Going through this at a young age taught me how life was taken for granted and could be seized at any time. Most kids do not have to worry about how many days they have left with their parents, but I did. I never knew what day would be the last with my mom, so I made the best out of every moment I had with her. Simple things like going out to dinner, or the car ride home were the moments when we talked the most. It was never awkward between us.  We always listened and enjoyed each other's company, no matter what the topic.\\The summer before my sophomore year of high school, my mother started complaining of back pains and decided to go to the doctor. They said she was fine, had to take it easy for a couple of weeks, and that she most likely pulled something in her back. She followed the doctor's orders but did not get better; the doctor decided to give her a MRI and the news that came back was not what anyone in my family expected. The cancer was back, stage 4 breast cancer which metastasized to her bones. The doctors gave her ten years to live. This news has been the hardest I have had to accept. My mom is my closest friend and knowing that she might only live ten more years was not only distressing but aggravating as well. She may never live to see my wedding day, or the births of her grandchildren. There are so many milestones that she will likely not be there for, and it has affected my personality and beliefs immensely.\\ I became serious, quiet, and almost mean to everyone around me partially because I did not know how to open up to anyone or share my feelings. I was so angry, this whole situation was unfair. All hope that I had for her living a long healthy life was gone. She was sick again, and my time with her was limited once more. Eventually, I told my AVID teacher who has helped me through this and I also began to open up more to my friends. They all have been so compassionate and kind, but the knowledge of my mom dying is hard to accept. \\The past couple of years have been the hardest of my life. Some days I would come home crying, worrying about how much time I would have left with my mom. She'd walk into my room and ask what was wrong, and as my eyes welled, I would tell her of how unjust the situation was, and how I did not want her to die. She would look at me with her big brown eyes, hold my hand and say, \"Sweetie, I'm still here, it is not going to happen today. Stop worrying about tomorrow, and start making the most out of the time we have now, and when tomorrow does come we will face that battle together.\"\\Ever since that day, when my mom saw that I was sad, she would say \"Not today.\" This reminded me not to worry so much about the future and live in the moment. Watching my mom deal with her disease shows me how I need to push past my uncertainties. I have become more independent and secure with who I am. I still have hard days, and sometimes I am just upset, but I don't let it stop me from moving forward and making a difference in other people's lives, like my mother did in mine. I share time with others, get to know their stories and try to help them push past their doubts. I listen to the struggles of their lives and remind them that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that they can overcome any situation they face, and that I will always be there for them. My mom has given me so much strength; not only have I helped others, but I work hard in school and don't let small disappointments stop me from accomplishing anything. I try my best to make my mom proud by working hard no matter what. I am not grateful that my mom has this disease, but I am thankful for the person I have become; outgoing, honest, determined, courageous, independent, confident, and brave.\n",

      "I come from a small city called Santa Cruz in California. It doesn't have much, but I still love it. But I'm definitely ready to move on to a big city. One of the biggest events in my life in a way it made me a stronger person and made me realize how childish and immature I had been. I never knew the real story to my parents separation and never clearly understood or cared over what happened and all my life until that event i always blamed my father for being the one to leave us and chose the bottle over his kids. One thing I did learn in 7th grade was that if I wanted to prove people wrong I had to do anything to be successful and happy, and so I'm very ambitious. One of my main goals in life is to be able to prove my mother wrong because she always told me I would end up homeless or cleaning houses, like herself, but for my sister's house. In a way this has shaped me to become a better person than my mother but also to not give up on my dreams just because someone tells me I can'tt or will never do it. In summer after my 10th grade my life changed. In the beginning of summer my friend started coming over all the time and after a while my mother got used to it until a month before school started. My mother did not like that I was transferring schools but she knew that is what I wanted even before I started high school, I wanted to go where all my friends were going but my sister didn't and since she was older she got first pick and went to a different one so I had to go there too.My mother was unhappy with those events so she basically kicked my friend out so I told my mother if she wanted her out I would leave too and and so she kicked us out. I called my father 7 days before school started to go pick me up. My father was in with not letting my friend live with us because he thought she was a bad influence when in reality I knew it was me. We were really poor and he didn't like the idea that a friend of mine would come over and take our food even if she did not. the house was no longer filled with food, we only had a few things in the fridge and when it was a little bit more full it was because i had gone to Dollar tree, a few blocks away, to buy frozen food and snacks. That week before school started my friend and I went to live with my father because my father finally met her and realized he was wrong on judging her before even knowing her. Having to live with 5 of my fathers family members in a 2 bedroom apartment with one bathroom, knowing that they did not like me or my friend, was horrific. Three months after living with my father we had to leave the apartments for having too many people living there. The most painful thing about our family was when all those 5 family members tried finding a place they didn't worry/care or include us in it. We were left on the street, again. We had nowhere else to go and apartments were being sucked up quickly, so we asked my godmother if we could stay with them for a few months and she let us. I knew that when a month ended I would cry at night knowing it was getting closer for us to move out and find a new place to live. Going back to Santa Cruz High school helped a lot because I had two very supportive friends. While living with my godmother my father promised we would move out by the end of March. In March it was my birthday and I still remember my birthday wish and it makes me tear up every time i remember it because I thought about how normal kids would wish for some expensive item while all I wished for shelter. My wish didn't come true, March ended, we moved out and my father stayed with a friend and I stayed with a girl I knew from school. I was so thankful she let me live with her. The girl's family was not perfect but she was just so lucky to have what she had. The happiest day of my life was when I was at school and received the best phone call ever. My father called me telling me that he received a call from some apartments near my school and that they were ready to let us move. This event has taught me that I know I want to have a house in the future and make programs that will help others find homes so they won't have to go through the same. And now i feel like Beyonce because \"my aspiration in life is to be happy.\"\n",

      "First, I begin by scanning the sheet of paper, looking for starting place. Then, I carefully place pencil to paper. Sometimes I'll use extra colors like black or blue; G2 pens are my favorite (they glide so smoothly across the page). Each product finishes as a messy collage of colored lines regardless of the inspiration. If I'm successful, I'll end up admiring an elegant result, but if I'm stuck, lots of paper will be crumpled up and thrown away. Mathematicians are quite liberal in their use of scratch paper. Such is the nature of the world of competitive math.\\  In my experience, I've seen different types of math, including \"calculator\" and \"contest\" math. Calculator math is boring; it's the structured, algorithmic math that screams for calculator use to simplify numerical nightmares. Calculators can carry out Herculean tasks but they cannot be programmed to be creative. But contest math is distinct from calculator math. Contest math is characterized by questions whose solutions require creative approaches -- an innately human ability. Whether competitive or as a hobby, contest math presents unique challenges ranging from algebra and number theory to counting and geometry. Of the two, contest math is more challenging, more engaging, and more fulfilling. This is my creative outlet; while others may write poetry or develop iPhone apps, this has been my world since middle school.\\Patience. Grit. Intuition. Perhaps these are not words that immediately come to mind when discussing math, but these are the demands contest math make. A typical problem can take between a handful of seconds to several days to solve. Along the way, nine-variable equations and other monsters may rear their heads. Although they hardly register as pivotal steps in the solution, these beasts serve as tests of endurance rather than measures of difficulty. And lastly, in a field strictly defined by axioms and theorems and characterized by rigorous logic, some of the best solutions can be entirely offbeat. Creative license can be taken to find an adequate solution.\\Creative problem-solving. That's the most important perspective I've gained from contest math. Spending time and resources (such as scratch paper) to develop a novel approach is a worthy investment, especially when conventional techniques may lead to exercises in futility. Results require risks. The best results, of course, are those that can be repeated, as opposed to one-time fixes. From adding hang time to my jump shot to evade taller defenders while playing basketball to making a cone amplifier out of posterboard for physics class to building a Rube Goldberg machine for my Science Olympiad team, I've learned to look for imaginative solutions over uninventive ones. They work over time too, with every pick-up game, every song, and every tournament. But they couldn't be found without the blocked shots, the broken speakers, or the machine's bungled steps. As with contest math, the solution is the product of multiple imperfections.\\My interest in contest math has formed the backbone of my identity as a problem-solver. It has provided a fulfilling venue to grapple with unfamiliar adversaries on a regular basis. That's what contest math shares the most with the world as a whole: the nature of their problems is unprecedented and unpredictable. Many of today's challenges cannot be solved through conventional means but, rather, require new ideas. Tomorrow, I might take a crack at peak oil or unequal access to water, carefully sketching a plan as I press pencil to paper. Whether I hit or miss, whether I admire an elegant result or crumple the page to start anew on a separate sheet, I'll be willing to take risks to search for even a single clue. But for today, I'll practice with polynomials and triangles.\n",

      "My most precious possession is a photo album. Between the dusty covers are pages and pages of pictures showing me with my robots. My passion for innovation started with a childhood fascination for nuts and bolts. The photo album records every step along the way to where I am now -starting with old black and white blurry shots and progressing to clear color pictures.\\The first photo in the album shows a little kid standing next to his simple toy car. Model cars were popular among boys, and every afternoon my friends and I would gather around a model car racing track to compete with each other. This activity with my friends was not enough. I was more interested in the car as a machine. A true machine should be more sophisticated, I thought. I began to spend many afternoons in the garage, working on my own creation -- a car that is smart enough to operate on all types of terrains. I designed every detail to make the car real and unique, sand papering the surface to round the corners and make it all even and smooth, and adding color coating to give it a metallic look. When I took my car to the playground, it instantaneously became the center of attention. I was 10 years old and so excited to have created this innovation that was so different and cool. \\Flipping through the pages of my album, I see a more recent photo. In the photo, the teenage me is pondering over a robot prototype. When I entered middle school, I naturally joined the Robotics club. For the first time, I had an instructor and started to learn the subject systematically, working on a project. The more I learned about the sophistication of functionality designs, the less I focused on the appearance of the robot. To make a robot that can replicate some human functions, wrapping the body of the robot with fake silicone skin would not help achieve the goal. In my project, Bumper Switches were installed around the body's hands to detect collisions and trigger reactions similar to those of humans. Ultrasonic Sensorswere put on the head to survey the landscape and determine the distance between the robot and an obstacle. The project had no deadline, so I kept experimenting with complex but more precise methods and components. Innovation to me, then, was to design sophisticated functions. Artists can design the look, but it is the engineers' responsibility to innovate and achieve the utmost function. \\Later in the album there is a whole section of photos of me at competitions. The object of one competition was for the robots to lift blocks of wood from the floor and drop them into different baskets. I had spent years designing my robot to perform all type of tasks and this competition would present no problem. However, once I started testing my robot, I saw the problem immediately -- although the design was sophisticated enough to allow the robot to perform the lifting and dropping, it was not a very efficient design. I had spent many nights designing the two legs to work like human legs, but caterpillars would be more suited to navigate a rugged path. Human like arms perform functions but conveyor belts would certainly pick up the blocks faster. After much trial and error and subsequent  redesigning, my robot looked drastically different from the one I started with, but every function that remained served a specific goal of increasing the speed and accuracy of picking up and dropping the wood blocks. This experience taught me an important lesson about innovation -- every robot design should serve a specifically defined goal and in this case, the purpose was to perform the lifting and dropping.\\Robots have accompanied me through my childhood. There is still plenty of space left in the album and more photos will be added in the future, with more robots and machines that will surely show the results of my increasing understanding of the meaning of innovation.\n",

      "Blood drips down the stained x-acto knife. My hands slip in the middle of cutting thousands of tiny hexagons from vinyl paper... for the third time tonight. I grab a bandage and toss the wrapper into the pile with all the others and carry on. I will not allow clumsiness to intimidate me.  With a ruler and bloodshot eyes, I peel each sticker and meticulously paste them one-sixteenth of an inch apart on a hexagonal jar. I coat the glass jar with four thin layers of sticky, yellow spray paint, then use a needle to stab each sticker to peel it from the jar. Another hexagonal pattern reveals itself just like that. I proceed to shed a couple more drops of blood before completing the task. Dipping a q-tip into nail-polish remover and rubbing the jar free of my DNA, I finally marvel at the culmination of six iterations of failed designs. Although my hands burn as the acetone stings my cuts, it's all worth it holding up my final mock-up of Beeleaf.\\\\Beeleaf, a do-it-yourself hot beverage kit that includes tea leaves and honey for a soothing drink at home, was the first prototype I had created for my arts and marketing portfolio. Inspired by the mathematically uniform hexagonal patterns of honeycombs, I designed this honey green tea kit to reflect simple, natural beauty. However, within the aesthetics lies function as well. The warm, inviting colors paired with an ergonomic hexagonal design and minimalist infographics create a seamless consumer experience. \\\\You see, ever since I was a little girl, television advertisements captivated my attention almost as much as the Saturday morning cartoons they interrupted. From the almost humorously bland QVC commercials to high budget Hershey animations, I instinctively noticed a fine line between tasteless and effective advertising. QVC segments presented the same direct, monotonous dialogue, appealing to rational reasoning but nothing else. On the other hand, Hershey ads allowed its audience to live vicariously through extravagant stories. The chocolatey wonders it contrived paired with catchy melodies transported me to a world bettered by Hershey kisses. After all, the most simple beauties of life are often experienced without forgoing either luxury or practicality. \\My passion for meshing form with function spilled over to a design project during the University of Pennsylvania's Summer Architecture program. Tasked with creating a bike repair shop that could withstand wear and tear of Mother Nature, I envisioned a mobile shed that would fuse the beauty of an art installment while performing repairs. In Philadelphia, ordinary bike repair stores are commonly tucked away between rows of stores, emphasizing speed and competitive costs above all else. But what does an extraordinary one look like? Inspired by utilitarian industrial architecture, but deciding to throw in a space-age material twist, I first included small windows that lit up the shed. Then, I designed the frame to be split open into two mobile sections that sat at both sides of a pathway, not only allowing customers to drop off their bikes with ease, but also for passersby to admire the bodywork of the shed and its occupants. With a curved roof, long cylindrical supports, and a surrounding garden, my mock-up stood stood tall as a stable refuge against the summer sun, the autumn breeze, the winter snow, and the spring showers. \\\\The difference between designers and artists lies within their contrasting purposes. Artists express their ideas and emotions freely while designers must restrain themselves in fulfilling specific tasks. However, when a designer caters purely to functionality, the end product becomes rigid and often dull. Surely, a sense of purpose is paramount, but creativity is often stifled in this pursuit. Without foregoing utility, I seek to reinforce \"form-and-function\" by achieving the same artistic impressions that encourage skepticism and evoke strong emotions. While creativity and functionality are rarely intermingled, I want to prove that when they do, beauty results.\n",

      "The lights blink on, as they wash over the stage. Illuminated, there's nothing but the soft 'ba-dum, ba-dum' of my nervous heart. The slightest sounds are jarring in the silence. We wait. 'Ba-dum, ba-dum.' Gradually, the speakers hum to life, and a soft melody floats out and finds me. I begin to move. \\\\This is pop and lock, a form of hip-hop commonly mislabeled as \"dubstep dancing.\" Suddenly, the muscles in my right arm clench and relax, a hit to the beat of the snare and the drum. My fingertips rise and fall, as a gentle breath of life travels up my left arm, making each segment pulse in turn: isolation, fine-tuned with hours and hours of practice to create this illusion of a wave. I continue, seamlessly flowing in and out of each move, transitioning from segment to segment, making the musical melody my own.\\\\As the tempo quickens, I hand the dance off to my partner. Frozen in place, I realize that my anxiety has silently slipped away. The beat shifts again, and the dance returns to me. The audience remains silent as I tweak each move from before in slight variations, forming different combinations. My mind is constantly calculating, exploring the numerous sequences I can create. My dancing comes alive. \\\\Walking off stage after the song, there's a tingling sensation in my chest, no longer stemming from a strangling anxiety but from the exhilaration of innovating and creating freely. A battleground for dancers is a field of endless possibilities difficult to find elsewhere, as each dancer develops a unique style. Nonetheless, I believe that I have found another outlet for my desire to innovate, STEM.\\\\Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, teleportation, all aspects of the sci-fi, the impossible, which may one day be reality. This is what is amazing about STEM. Like dance, the possibilities are almost endless. As scientists today are constantly making discoveries in a variety of fields, what seemed like the unattainable yesterday has suddenly become possible. I have grown up in this age of unmatched progress and want to be a part of the new technological revolution as humanity progresses towards the future. To do so, I have already begun the process of training to become such an innovator.\\\\Ever since the seventh grade, I have kept a record of ideas and fleeting thoughts which have entered my mind: an app which could turn any smartphone into a mouse by utilizing the sensors within and connecting it to a laptop through bluetooth, headphones which communicate the number of decibels that the user is experiencing to help aid in the prevention of hearing loss, the list goes on.\\\\Some of these ideas, I have tried to make into reality. My science fair project from last year, Picasso Bot, is a robot with basic artistic abilities which draws randomized squares and circles of varying sizes around an existing picture, forming a unique composition. Another project that I am currently undertaking is the creation of a music discovery website called Currents. However, during Current's development, I realized just how lacking my technical skills were. As a result, I have been studying HTML/CSS, Python, Javascript, and Java, but I recognize that I have only begun to scratch the surface of the technical aspects. \\\\In the future, I hope to be an entrepreneur in the tech industry and develop new technologies that will change our world. However, to do this requires more than innovation and creative thinking, advanced technical skills, which I hope to acquire more of in college, will also be necessary. Furthermore, unlike in dance, where there are very few restrictions, science has many fundamental laws that I must firmly understand before developing ways to make the impossible possible. With a degree in engineering, I will become more than a dreamer. I will be an inventor.\n",

      "Though I am a professional pianist, growing up at the Bavarian National Theater, where my father was music director, has caused my world to be greatly shaped by opera. With its capacity to inspire both emotion and imagination, opera has nourished me.\\\\One production particularly stands out: Wagner's Ring Cycle as staged by Andreas Kriegenburg. The Cycle centers on a magical ring with maleficent features: it gifts its owner with absolute power, but eventually annihilates him.\\ \\Rheingold, the first of the four operas that constitute the Ring Cycle: a bell rings three times, the lights dim, the conductor enters the pit, the audience grows hushed. The orchestra plays the opening in the dark. Intricate, interlaced chords convey disgust, anguish and love. The harmonies of each dense chord dig into our psyches and our souls.\\\\Time is suspended. The flying notes seem to freeze as they express eternal themes - problems of dread and longing that have tormented every generation of humans since the dawn of mankind.  The intensity of the score strips me of my defenses, leaving me vulnerable and trembling before its power. I revel in this sensation and in the music's ability to stop time. Too often, as time is precious and feels scarce, I cannot bring myself to use it reflecting on my emotions.\\ \\The curtains open, revealing hundreds of nude figures painting themselves blue.  In pairs, they embark on a magnificent, sensual dance: undulating, they fervently wrap themselves around one another, moving together as a body of water. Accompanied by Wagner's theme on the Rhine, their erotic, wave-like gestures create a formidable effect, combining the power of the river and its magical gold ring with the element of seduction that reigns over the Cycle.\\\\I watch in uneasy fascination as the production unfolds its stark aesthetic. It employs no 3D effects, no extravagant decorations. Using only human bodies, precise movement, and a few hand-made costumes, Kriegenburg brings the production to life.  He gives us undiluted authenticity, perfectly coordinated with the music.\\\\A low, rhythmic motif sounds, heralding the entrance of two fearless giants. The singers climb onto massive blocks of crushed humans to sing their arias. Their bodies constitute only the heads of the giants; actors stand on top of each other to create arms and legs. In a matter of seconds, the giants' ruthless nature is conveyed.\\\\By pointing its finger at that which tempts us, at our hunger for power, and at our fear of death, the opera leads us on the most compelling journey of all: the exploration of ourselves. It concludes with the construction of a bridge to the majestic castle of the gods. A spectacular drum echoes through the theater as a god produces lightning to form the bridge. Actors carry aluminum-wrapped pieces of cardboard up an inclined stage and wave their makeshift mirrors at the audience, reminding us of our humanity. \\\\Opera provides an escape into a realm of emotional truth, allowing me to delight in discovering my own feelings. It has also shaped my aspirations to extend this revealing journey to all members of society. With its capacity to convey emotions that remain inexplicable despite the technology of our century, opera holds the power to bring inspiration and curiosity into anyone's life. In our modern world where so many elements are known and defined, I hope to drive individuals to keep exploring the unknown.\n",

      "Living in such a culturally diverse state as California, paradoxes are ubiquitous. Diversity breeds paradoxes. The paradox that has been most prevalent in my life has been my parents' relationship and its enduring nature. \\\\At its basic level, my parents' relationship is a beautiful love story. My father was born in Tehran, Iran and was raised as a devout Muslim. Attending Islamic schools, he enrolled in the Iranian military to fight a religious war against Iraq during the 1980's. In contrast, my mother was born in a very impoverished community in East Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants. Raised with Catholic teachings, she once entertained the thought of becoming a nun in order to fulfill her religious duties. \\\\Indeed, my parents grew up in entirely different cultures, but as the old adage goes, opposites attract. Thankfully for me, the environment my parents cultivated has instilled within me a holistic, rich, and vibrant perspective. Specifically, my family's background has enhanced my cultural awareness and ability to accept others. My upbringing has not always been easy; my Iranian side of the family are devout Muslims and have very stringent standards for female behavior. Women are forbidden to dance, but dance is my passion. Women are not encouraged to pursue education, but I thrive in the academic sphere. Women are obedient, but I had the iron-clad will of my fierce Mexican mother. Women are not supposed to lead, but I shined in my role as a leader, winning president for ASB, junior, and sophomore class.\\\\That said, the tug-of-war within my identity had its fair share of challenges, challenges that I eventually overcame with a better and stronger sense of identity.  And although there have been these challenges, my cultural background is incredibly vibrant: I've celebrated Persian New Year and Cinco de Mayo, I've eaten Koobideh and tamales, and I've sipped on Chai and Horchata. Apart from this gastronomical adventure, I've developed a significant cultural awareness that has fostered my thirst to learn about different cultures and people. \\\\Such awareness was amplified when I was invited to join the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHHS), which has allowed me to gain valuable insight into different cultures and experiences. The NSHHS hosts global conferences. By attending these conferences, I've interacted with people from various continents. Through such interactions, I have learned compassion and how to work collaboratively with others. Because I'm interested in pursuing a career in government and politics, these conferences have furthered my desire to understand the inner-workings of government. I've met and conversed with eminent figures such as Al Gore and Condoleezza Rice, and have also had the privilege of attending both of President Obama's inaugurations. From these conferences, I've gained a deep knowledge of how governmental systems operate. More importantly, I gained a desire to study political science and focus on international affairs. \\\\I am drawn to the study of political science because public policy and government shape society. Whether it be the rate of taxes or international affairs, politics is rooted in and impactful to almost every aspect of life. Even when I volunteered to canvass for an incumbent campaigning for the Water Board District, I felt as though I was making an impact, albeit a small one.  I want to play an active role in forming public policy and in shaping society; I hope to bring passionate, logic-based ideas to the forefront of global politics. Furthermore, immersing myself in political science would give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of government and policy on both national and international levels. \\\\My desire to pursue political science taught me that while my Iranian-Mexican background has brought many trials, it has ultimately taught me important life lessons. It has challenged my beliefs and self-identity and instilled in me a fire. This fire drives me to learn, to explore, to be more than an Iranian-Mexican. It is a fire that will light the pathway for further intellectual growth and world discovery as an advocate and scholar within the realm of political science.  It is this fire that will inspire me to become a true agent of change.\n"
