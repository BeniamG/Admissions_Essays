    "## Introduction to Unsupervised Approaches using scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two libraries that dominate text analysis in Python. The first is NLTK, which implements a range of natural language processing techniques. You learned about this in part 2 of this series yesterday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dominant library is scikit-learn, which, at its most basic, provides a function to create a memory-efficient document-term matrix. It also implements a variety of quite sophisticated machine learning techniques that you can use on your text. It's a powerful library, and one you will continually return to as you advance in text analysis (and looks great on your CV!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because scikit-learn is such a large and powerful library the goal today is not to become experts, but instead learn the basic functions in the library and gain an intuition about how you might use it to do text analysis. We'll give you the keys to the kingdom: you go explore! To give an overview, here are some of the things you can do using scikit-learn:\n",
    "* word weighting\n",
    "* feature extraction\n",
    "* text classification / supervised machine learning\n",
    "    * L2 regression\n",
    "    * classification algorithms such as nearest neighbors, SVM, and random forest\n",
    "* clustering / unsupervised machine learning\n",
    "    * k-means\n",
    "    * pca\n",
    "    * cosine similarity\n",
    "    * LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll start with the Document Term Matrix (DTM). The DTM is the bread and butter of most computational text analysis techniques, both simple and more sophisticated methods. In this lesson we will use Python's scikit-learn package learn to make a document term matrix from a .csv Music Reviews dataset (collected from MetaCritic.com). We will then use the DTM and a word weighting technique called tf-idf (term frequency inverse document frequency) to identify important and discriminating words within this dataset (utilizing the Pandas package). The illustrating question: what words distinguish reviews of Rap albums, Indie Rock albums, and Jazz albums? \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will use the DTM to get an introduction to one method for uncovering patterns or themes within text: LDA, a topic modeling algorithm. Again, this will just be an introduction. Look for additional workshops in the future that will get into topic modeling in more detail.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "* Understand the DTM and why it's important to text analysis\n",
    "* Learn how to create a DTM from a .csv file\n",
    "* Learn basic functionality of Python's package scikit-learn\n",
    "* Understand tf-idf scores, and word scores in general\n",
    "* Learn a simple way to identify distinctive words\n",
    "* Implement a basic topic modeling algorithm and learn how to tweak it\n",
    "* In the process, gain more familiarity and comfort with the Pandas package and manipulating data\n",

    "* *Document Term Matrix*:\n",
    "    * a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.\n",
    "* *TF-IDF Scores*: \n",
    "    *  short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "* *Topic Modeling*:\n",
    "    * A statistical model to uncover abstract topics within a text. It uses the co-occurrence fo words within documents, compared to their distribution across documents, to uncover these abstract themes. The output is a list of weighted words, which indicate the subject of each topic, and a weight distribution across topics for each document.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* *LDA*:\n",
    "    * Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A implementation of topic modeling that assumes a Dirichlet prior. It does not take document order into account, unlike other topic modeling algorithms.\n",

       "\"Grandmothers are essential in the lives of their grandchildren. Taking on the role of a mother figure at any given moment is time consuming yet rewarding for any grandmother. Some grandmothers have choices of either wanting to care for their grandchildren or leaving them to be cared for by others. When my parents finalized their divorce it was my grandmother who sacrificed her lifestyle in order to take on the role of a mother figure in my life. Once living in a retirement lifestyle and socializing with friends has now turned into caring for two young rambunctious boys.\\\\\\\\While in first grade I believed I was invincible, I lived in a beautiful two story home, a star war theme bedroom that I did not have to share with my older brother, loving grandparents who often visited, and hardworking parents who provided for our family. All of a sudden, my idealistic world came to end when my parents decided to part ways. There was no inkling that mother decided to leave our happy home. At a young age, I could not quite grasp as to what made her want to leave our family. Even though I held her tightly, she walked away. Sadden and angry I wanted to cry out loudly, so my parents could hear my silent pain; however, it was grandmother who brought comfort to my days by wiping my tears and singing me to sleep. There would be nights that I would wake up screaming and she would brush the top of my head until I fell into a deep slumber. \\\\\\\\In the meantime, I lacked motivation and refused to complete my schoolwork; therefore, my grades increasingly declined. After school, my grandmother greeted me with a big grin and tight hug. She had a snack tray of fruits waiting for me to eat. Slowly, I would bite down on an apple and ponder about my life. Each day I felt a strong need to reach out to grandmother and tell her that her kind words and small gestures took the pain away. Her affection has given me resolution to accept that my life without mother will be fine. Moreover, she became the very essence of my life. \\\\\\\\When I encounter someone who trudges on a similar path, I am not hesitant to share my experience. To this very day, grandmother is my hero. As a senior in high school, grandmother is slow in movement but keen in hearing. Snacks of fruits still away me and she strokes my hair. This sense of touch is meaningful as it has become the assurance that I am the young man that she has raised me to be. Holding back my tears I see my dainty grandmother who loves me unconditionally just as any mother loves their own child. Gone are the days of waking up screaming, lacking motivation, and incomplete assignments. Immersing myself with grandmother's care and wisdom, I am now invincible. Compassion is one thing grandmother has demonstrated in life.\""

    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. We saw a few ways to this yesterday, using natural language processing. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: word scores. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is *tf-idf* scores. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",

    "Frequency counts and tf-idf scores are done at the word level. There are other methods of exporatory or unsupervised analysis on the document level and by examining the co-occurrence of words within documents. Scikit-learn allows for many of these methods, including:\n",

    "We'll run through an example of topic modeling here. Again, the goal is not to learn everything you need to know about topic modeling. Instead, this will provide you some starter code to run a simple model, with the idea that you can use this base of knowledge to explore this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the most basic and the oldest version of topic modeling. We will run this in one big chunk of code. Our challenge: use our knowledge of scikit-learn that we gained aboe to walk through the code to understand what it is doing. Your challenge: figure out how to modify this code to work on your own data, and/or tweak the parameters to get better output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we will be using a different dataset for this technique. The music reviews in the above dataset are often short, one word or one sentence reviews. Topic modeling is not really appropriate for texts that are this short. Instead, we want texts that are longer and are composed of multiple topics each. For this exercise we will use a database of children's literature from the 19th century. \n",

       "\"I remember first arriving in America at the age of  in the year . By august, I began preschool and for couple days it was hard to leave my mom's side because until now I have never truly left my mom's side, but slowly I began to adapt a form of independence.  Within a year I finally began kindergarten. Within this year, the Teacher began teaching me Basic English beginning with the ABC song, count to  orally, learning to write my English name, how to hold a materials such as scissors and pencils, and how to hold a book properly from looking at words left to right. This was the first step in leading me into the society. As I moved up in my grades in elementary school, I began building up more knowledge involving math and English and at the same time these experiences began to help me create my pre-stage dream. After elementary school, I moved up to middle school. These  years of middle school has broadened my knowledge with math, science, English, and new classes involving electives and a stricter PE cession that helped me to understand the importance in keeping healthy, but the main course was introducing me to the world of sports such as basketball. In the beginning of the year I wondered and looked around as kids played basketball games during lunch and before school starts. I was fascinated at their games and quickly began creating a form of interest in this sport. Although in the following  years in attempting to try out for the basketball team I failed in making it, but this began to help shape my aspiration of having persistence and continuing shooting or playing games alone when I have free time. By the end of middle school, I felt my dream was being to change again and this time it is the feeling of wanting to play basketball in high school. The following year, I have finally entered into my high school year, but before then, during the summer of that year, I was introduced to American football.  In the beginning, I was lost, but in due process seeing how the upper classmate began teaching me the basics, I started to feel a form of warmth as if I am being accepted into this team.  By the end of summer, school started and that year it was surprising confusing because classes were so diffused from the floors to floors with a time limit of getting to the class or else you were marked tardy, but within couple of day I had understood the system.  By the end of the school each day, I started going to official football practice and began learning the plays and proper style to use my body. Following games after games, as I competed with the opposite tem, even though it was very rough and brutal, but I felt joy in doing so. As days past and games gone by one at a time, this  sports has begun to shape me into wanting to do better and more with my life and thus this feeling has shaped my dream of wanting to go to the next level to compete which is college football. School was an influential area, but there were other areas that gave me influence such as volunteering. In the year of th grade, I volunteered and was part of a program in self-help for the elderly called Cisco. In the program, I was taught computer functions and their basic parts. While the program didn't really influence me too much, but it hinted me that this futures lies infinite possibility in jobs and each one has their specific meaning. The volunteer I did was arriving at the center and teaching elderly the basic function of computer system such as the web, mouse, keyboard, download, and computer update for many weeks after - pm to around - pm. Teaching them was not easy, but doing so was joyful because watching them putting so much effort in trying to learn each day even though they were old caused me to feel proud of myself in sharing my knowledge and experience to my neighborhood for the better of tomorrow. This has inspired me to want to do more volunteer because through volunteer I can see smiles being born from one another's face and helping one another form friendship and helping others also better oneself in experience buildup.\""

       "'In a world of fairy tales and magic people don\\'t exist, yet in a world of people fairy tales may become a reality. I never knew what high school is going to be like except nothing compared to the movies. Every kid dreams of growing up going to a good high school and college especially when it comes to building an amazing future for themselves. I was one of those lucky kids the help and support of my parents and family I got the grades that I needed to pass and get into Westview high school one of the best high schools. Where I lived had required me to go to a different high school but my grades got my inter-district transfer the seal of approval. As time went on summer departed and came the beginning of a fresh new start in my life one that I was going to make the best and most memorable next four years of my life.Time simply had passed and I made so many new friends just by talking to the people around me oh and the principal had cracked a few jokes make us laugh. I went to all my classes and met my teachers some of the nicest adults I\\'ve met so far. Everything was going well my classes, my teachers and no stress as thought out. I want mistaken all of this was taking everything in my life for granted. My lesson was taught put in a very horrible matter under tough circumstances. \\\\               \\\\              Friday, September  the day before my three-day weekend so excited not knowing was going to hit me. Saturday, Sunday pass then came Monday, September  Labor Day I got up early to help make breakfast. As everyone sat at the dinner table smiles were going around until we all finished eating. I went upstairs to wake up my sleepyhead sister by the time I got down my dad had already left for work. My uncle afterwards decided to go to breakfast with some friends but on his way there he decided to stop by dad\\'s office to pick up something for his car. He grabbed the wrench and started working on his car then suddenly he heard my dad calling out his name and immediately rushed to him. My father lying on the bathroom floor was quickly pulled out my uncle knew something serious was wrong. He dialed  and immediately the paramedics arrived the lady quickly looked at him and said he had a heart attack he needs to be rushed to hospital right now. They boarded him and put him in the ambulance. One exit before reaching the hospital he had a second heart attack. They rushed him in as a code blue known as cardiopulmonary arrest. As my family and I waited impatiently in the hallway the doctor came out and my family and I he put for stents in my dad\\'s heart. As soon as the doctors finished talking the nurse ran out and scream for the doctor. He had his third and final heart attack. He flat lined, his heart completely gave up. The nurse quickly rushed on top of him and began CPR everyone around him looking through his monitors trying to see what had happened. CPR didn\\'t work so they shocked him with the paddles six times, which is the maximum limit number for adults. The doctor said let\\'s try one more time this time from the front and back of his heart. He gained his pulse back, his heart started beating again, and the doctors saved his life. They told us that there was a new study and they had to freeze my dad\\'s body in order to not let him get brain damage. My family and I agreed immediately anything to save his life. My dad got into a coma.\\\\\\\\               Four days after this still no sign of him going to wake up. After a week the doctors told us to call all of the relatives because he may not make it out alive. At this point I looked at everyone and all I saw was pain, sadness and so much fear. We did as the doctors said. Two weeks went by and one Friday I was in gym class and my mom pulled me out of class. I got so scared I thought oh god something happened I wasn\\'t prepared to hear anyone or see anything I just wanted to shut everything out of my mind my heart started racing my eyes shut my head went down. I got in the car and asked what happened and she said you have to wait and see now I was even more scared. We got to the hospital I walked up to my dad\\'s through his eyes were open grabbed me and he just cried asking why? \"why did this happen to him?\" I didn\\'t know what to say but I didn\\'t care all I cared about was that I wasn\\'t dreaming and he was really awake. I told him it doesn\\'t matter what matters is that you\\'re okay. Everyone was smiling and his doctors had these smiles on their faces after these days of not being able to show their faces to us. We all walked out and I cried so hard but only out of happiness they were the tears often indescribable joy I was feeling. I always knew I wants to be a doctor but until that day I didn\\'t know what kind and I found my answer. I want to be the one who saves someone else\\'s life. My world was reconstructed and I will never forget to never take anything in my life for granted no matter how small or big every moment is to be cherished and my father\\'s miracle made me realize this.'"

       "'Can one individual have an effect on the environment? I previously found it simple to look at the world around me with rose-colored glasses, just taking what I needed without regard.  \\\\\\\\Through contact with my surroundings, I became concerned for the safety and conservation of our natural environment as well as the suppression of the many factors that destroy it.  I have witnessed the fragile relationship between man and nature and the toxicity that threatens both the health of the environment and the impact on our population. \\\\\\\\Los Angeles, with its population of  million, has many appealing features such near-perfect weather.  However, LA is also infamous for being number one as America\\'s worst smog-polluted city. I consider myself fortunate that my school and the city of Santa Monica opened my eyes, allowing me to help face the problems of man-made environmental destruction. \\\\\\\\My \"immersion\" in the environment began with my interest and certification as a SCUBA diver.  At age  I received my Open Water SCUBA license while diving in the waters off Catalina, and have since obtained certifications in Advanced Open Water and Rescue Diving.  The Rescue Diver certification was the most challenging, yet most rewarding course I\\'ve ever taken. I learned crucial skills such as CPR both above and under water, immersion sea management, and the ability to both rescue a panicked or unresponsive diver.  Most importantly however, the certification opened my eyes to a reality far beyond a simple academic study. SCUBA has allowed me to directly observe the beauty and fragility of the undersea world and our environment as a whole.\\\\\\\\From a perspective few people see directly, I have witnessed the unfortunate result of our indifference to the environment: thousands of plastic trash bags entangled in the kelp off Catalina, floating islands of plastic bottles, the result of ocean acidification, destroyed coral reefs and trash where it shouldn\\'t exist. My exploration of the underwater world through SCUBA has helped me transition from a superficial appreciation of the ocean\\'s beauty to a realization of my mission to help sustain this precious ecosystem. \\\\\\\\Clearly the ocean isn\\'t the only ecosystem being heavily affected by pollution. Examining my own city has also opened my eyes to the sickness of human carelessness, seeing the canopy of smog rising above the city of LA and trash strewn everywhere. This awareness has struck me deeply, as I feel extremely motivated to work toward solving the environmental problems we face as well as teaching others about environmental issues. \\\\\\\\Throughout high school I have been involved in an environmental activist school club called Team Marine. Their goal was the same as mine; to help shift societal awareness towards environmental conservation. Together with Team Marine I traveled to Sacramento to lobby for the ban of single use plastic bags to both State Senators and Assembly members on both sides of the floor. \\\\\\\\The result was the passing of SB ! Single use plastic bags will be banned in the State of California in . As a Team Marine member I have worked on numerous other projects such as a conversion of a  super beetle into an electric car, city wide cigarette studies, and local bans on plastic bags and Styrofoam boxes. I strongly believe that being a part of this team has become an important step in my education and experience towards my mission of ensuring our planet\\'s future.\\\\\\\\The experience and knowledge that I have gained from my desire to help my community is now a passion for environmental science and the protection of our ecosystem. I plan on continuing my studies in Environmental Science as a university major.  I plan on working in the field of environmental engineering and environmental recovery and research, particularly in the Pacific Ocean and the coast of California. My mission is to utilize my education and experience to accomplish my goal of leading our society towards a healthy relationship with our precious environment. As an individual, yes, I can and will make a difference.'"

       "'My parents migrated from Mexico to the United States in order to provide me with a better education and a more stable household. As a young child, my parents always emphasized the importance of pursuing a higher education because it would provide me with a stable career. Since neither of my parents had the resources to receive an education in Mexico, they took advantage of the educational opportunities in the U.S. for myself and my younger sibling. However, living in poverty became the biggest struggle for my parents, and at times they were not always able to put food on our table. I saw my parents suffer from obtaining minimum-wage jobs that always put them at risk of becoming jobless. At the age of fifteen, living in East Oakland where crime, poverty, and the loss of hopes are considered \"norms\", I decided to help my family by applying for a part-time job in order to support my family financially. After working in the food industry and being a high school student, I realized that my school was not preparing me enough for the rigors of college. In my high school, I had many limited resources since it was underfunded. I was not provided with many AP classes or college exposure. With the limited resources my school provided, I realized that I needed to challenge myself by taking community college classes that would expose me and prepare me for college courses. I sought my college counselor and I was informed about how to enroll in community college classes, since I could not receive help from my family. After learning how to enroll in community college\\'s courses, I enrolled in a Cultural Geography and an English A course in order to expose myself to the college environment. When I failed my first quiz, I quickly learned that in order to succeed in college it is essential to reach out and connect with your professors, and seek for extra support, so I did. My community college courses prepared me for the rigors of college along with  developing independence and making sure my responsibilities were taken care of. Since I come from a low-income household, working was not an option but instead it was more of an obligation. My help was needed to pay certain bills, and purchase food, and other necessary household expenses. Balancing work and school was often complex and challenging because it took time away from my studying, but I was able to develop time-management and leadership skills in order to balance out my responsibilities. Being enrolled in challenging college courses, attending high school, and working fifteen to twenty hours per week, allowed me to learn more about the type of student I am and helped me prioritize my needs. Now that I have a better understanding of how to balance my time, school, and work, I now know how to manage my time efficiently. I have learned how to create a timeline once receiving my syllabus in order to turn in assignments on time, study for tests on my own and with others, and attend office hours to connect and receive individual support from my professors. Taking college courses while in high school helped me shape my dreams and aspirations of pursuing a higher education and being the first in my family to obtain a college degree. I plan to receive a bachelor\\'s degree in English, attend graduate school and receive a master\\'s in Education, and be the first in my family to receive a Ph. D. I plan to come back and teach in low-income communities where I can use my knowledge and previous experiences to better and support the lives of low-income students. I plan to be a role model for my family and others in order to prove that living in poverty is never an exception to set aside the importance of receiving a higher education.'"

       "'Anxiety rose as I gingerly passed the San Diego Airport stores, looking for the boarding gate for Baltimore, Maryland. Not only was I scared of traveling alone as a minor for the first time, I grew increasingly anxious of the idea of a -day Leadership Summit for Medicine and Healthcare in Johns Hopkins University with total strangers. At the summit, what first started as fear transformed into determination to find the field that captures my passion. \\\\\\\\My heart wrenches when I see homeless people lugging a cart of recyclables and clothing, a small oxygen tank with tubes attached to their bodies, or cardboard with black marker asking for help, as I drive by some streets in San Diego. The homeless reminds me of the increasing number of veterans suffering from multifaceted medical conditions as a result of deployment to war zones. They struggle from physical, psychological, and psychosocial issues concerning themselves, work, and family; they are prone to fall into the cracks of the system and become homeless.  Homelessness, particularly veteran homelessness, is personal to me for two reasons: first, I am a military dependent with a father who has been deployed overseas for nearly four years; and second, volunteer work brought me close to these veterans. In , I had a first-hand experience working with wounded warriors in one of the programs of the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. I grew to understand that wounded veterans require assistance to lead normal lives as they struggle with the difficulties of post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, alcohol abuse, phantom pain in amputations, and depression. Their will to thrive amidst these difficulties and their selfless service inspired me to become part of a team that provides quality medical care, with the hope that veterans like them will thrive in society and not end up homeless.  \\\\\\\\Similarly, news about relatives and acquaintances suffering or dying from diseases in the Philippines affect me. Born and raised in the Philippines in my early years, I feel the responsibility to provide quality medical care in the Philippines, particularly the underprivileged Filipinos. Dengue, for example, is still an endemic disease that takes toll on the Philippine population. My cousins had their first-hand experience of the disease at a critical stage; fortunately, my aunt is a physician with a specialized training on diseases like dengue. Rainy season in the Philippines has become a time of fear for dengue infection and death of loved ones -- it does not have to be that way. Another illness that is causing fear and death, and has led locals to believe as the cause of unexplained deaths is cancer. Imagine a wealthy patient in a developed country like the United States lose everything to battle cancer, and an underprivileged patient in a developing country like the Philippines who has no means to survive the illness; medical care should be accessible not just to those who can afford it but also to those who equally need it. \\\\\\\\The Leadership Summit paved clarity and direction to my future. Whether it be feeding the homeless at St. Vincent de Paul Village, distributing basic necessities and clothing to the homeless in the streets of San Diego, or visiting the orphanages in Tijuana, Mexico, the Summit affirmed my conviction that service is an integral part of learning. Being a recipient of the Outstanding Service award from the Diocese of San Diego, is a humbling reminder that my chosen career path to become a medical professional will be more meaningful and fulfilling when true service is part of the learning and life equation. \\\\\\\\Next year, I will embark in another opportunity to grow as I represent my high school and the State of California to the Congress of Future Physicians and Medical Scientists in the University of Massachusetts. This time, excitement and optimism replace what used to be anxiety and fear. All I need to do is \"keep my eyes on the stars, and my feet on the ground.\"'"
