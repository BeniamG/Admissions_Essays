      "Living in such a culturally diverse state as California, paradoxes are ubiquitous. Diversity breeds paradoxes. The paradox that has been most prevalent in my life has been my parents' relationship and its enduring nature. \\\\At its basic level, my parents' relationship is a beautiful love story. My father was born in Tehran, Iran and was raised as a devout Muslim. Attending Islamic schools, he enrolled in the Iranian military to fight a religious war against Iraq during the 1980's. In contrast, my mother was born in a very impoverished community in East Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants. Raised with Catholic teachings, she once entertained the thought of becoming a nun in order to fulfill her religious duties. \\\\Indeed, my parents grew up in entirely different cultures, but as the old adage goes, opposites attract. Thankfully for me, the environment my parents cultivated has instilled within me a holistic, rich, and vibrant perspective. Specifically, my family's background has enhanced my cultural awareness and ability to accept others. My upbringing has not always been easy; my Iranian side of the family are devout Muslims and have very stringent standards for female behavior. Women are forbidden to dance, but dance is my passion. Women are not encouraged to pursue education, but I thrive in the academic sphere. Women are obedient, but I had the iron-clad will of my fierce Mexican mother. Women are not supposed to lead, but I shined in my role as a leader, winning president for ASB, junior, and sophomore class.\\\\That said, the tug-of-war within my identity had its fair share of challenges, challenges that I eventually overcame with a better and stronger sense of identity.  And although there have been these challenges, my cultural background is incredibly vibrant: I've celebrated Persian New Year and Cinco de Mayo, I've eaten Koobideh and tamales, and I've sipped on Chai and Horchata. Apart from this gastronomical adventure, I've developed a significant cultural awareness that has fostered my thirst to learn about different cultures and people. \\\\Such awareness was amplified when I was invited to join the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHHS), which has allowed me to gain valuable insight into different cultures and experiences. The NSHHS hosts global conferences. By attending these conferences, I've interacted with people from various continents. Through such interactions, I have learned compassion and how to work collaboratively with others. Because I'm interested in pursuing a career in government and politics, these conferences have furthered my desire to understand the inner-workings of government. I've met and conversed with eminent figures such as Al Gore and Condoleezza Rice, and have also had the privilege of attending both of President Obama's inaugurations. From these conferences, I've gained a deep knowledge of how governmental systems operate. More importantly, I gained a desire to study political science and focus on international affairs. \\\\I am drawn to the study of political science because public policy and government shape society. Whether it be the rate of taxes or international affairs, politics is rooted in and impactful to almost every aspect of life. Even when I volunteered to canvass for an incumbent campaigning for the Water Board District, I felt as though I was making an impact, albeit a small one.  I want to play an active role in forming public policy and in shaping society; I hope to bring passionate, logic-based ideas to the forefront of global politics. Furthermore, immersing myself in political science would give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of government and policy on both national and international levels. \\\\My desire to pursue political science taught me that while my Iranian-Mexican background has brought many trials, it has ultimately taught me important life lessons. It has challenged my beliefs and self-identity and instilled in me a fire. This fire drives me to learn, to explore, to be more than an Iranian-Mexican. It is a fire that will light the pathway for further intellectual growth and world discovery as an advocate and scholar within the realm of political science.  It is this fire that will inspire me to become a true agent of change.\n",

      "Since kindergarten, I have attended The American School in Japan (ASIJ), which serves the international community in Tokyo.  And since I was two years old, I have lived in Japan, a country with a very distinctive culture and a dense social fabric.  By living simultaneously in these two different worlds, I have come to see the value of interacting with the world globally, with a positive and receptive outlook, and engaging in a deep and meaningful way in the local environment.  To me this is a very interesting and fulfilling way to live, and I plan to continue this way of life through a career in international business with a focus on Asia.\\\\ASIJ is American in many respects - for example, in terms of its curriculum and sports teams - but its basic orientation is global.  Our students and teachers come from over 38 countries, including from Europe, South America and throughout Asia.  Although the students typically speak English among themselves, there is no dominant national culture - students arrive at ASIJ from all over and fit in quickly.\\\\In addition to the diverse environment on campus, my school activities and studies bring me regularly in contact with the broader world.  In cross-country and track, I have competed in pan-Asian meets with runners from across the region, and I have travelled twice to Thailand with a school group to work with a local NGO there in support of rural development.  In the summers, I have studied Chinese intensively in Taiwan and Shanghai, staying with a local host family in Shanghai.  \\\\As a result of all this, it is very natural for me to see the world as a comfortable and accessible place.  I believe that my background, experience and language skills will help me prosper in the increasingly global world - where immigration into developed countries and cross-cultural contacts are becoming more and more common, and businesses must achieve success on an international scale.\\\\At the same time - because I have lived in Tokyo continuously for more than 16 years, and am native fluent in Japanese - I have engaged in a deep way in the local Japanese community.  For example, I attended a Japanese public elementary school for five summers; I played basketball on Japanese club teams for over five years; and I am currently running on a Japanese track club, organized and led by former runners at the national level.  In addition, this summer I worked a variety of part-time jobs on the local economy, through a Japanese employment service.  \\\\Through these experiences, I have made close connections with many Japanese people, and have developed some understanding and respect for how Japan works, and how to live and engage successfully in this unique and fascinating country.  My experience in living in Japan has given me insights into success in international business as well.  To succeed outside its national borders, a business needs more than just global scope - it must have close and sustained connections with the local communities where it operates.  \\\\This interplay of global and local fascinates me.  I believe that businesses and societies must be oriented in both ways to achieve success in the coming decades - competing with the very best on an international basis, while focusing on and serving local needs and requirements.  I am very fortunate to have lived globally and locally in my life to date, and this is how I want to live going forward, as a business person and more broadly - being part of the local community wherever I am, while connecting with people on a global basis.\n",

      "\"Bringing art to kids in need.\" This is not only the mission statement of the non-profit 1KID, but also a cause I highly support.  At 1KID, we believe it is important to supplement under-funded schools in developing countries with art in order to provide a creative outlet for impoverished kids. My experience developing 1KID, my education, and my international experience have inspired me to become a successful businesswoman and continue advocating for improved education in third-world countries.  I hope to always travel around the world to have first-hand experiences with new cultures and be in a diverse work environment in order to achieve my dream.\\\\To begin with, developing 1KID, a non-profit which has raised over $10,000 to provide supplies to under-funded schools around the globe, has greatly influenced my goal to be a businesswomen and support education. As a member on the development committee, I learned to voice my opinions and make compromises with others. We had one especially large event, our second art show which featured local student and professional art.  Being treasurer, I managed the finances of the fundraiser as well as helped execute it.  We traveled the city requesting donations of professional art, and we decided how to advertise the event.  Surprisingly, I absolutely loved working together and leading a great team to execute the grand vision we all held. Times like these confirmed business as my desired career.  1KID was my chance for me to make a positive difference through a seminal idea that we implemented and set in action.  A business degree will allow me to keep supporting the same cause of education on a larger scale, so that I can continue to have a positive impact.\\\\Starting my own business requires me to be a visionary and to be determined to make my goals a reality. Luckily, these are qualities I found in myself through my world at school, which has influenced me to always want a challenging education and has taught me to work hard towards my goal.  The advanced classes I have taken presented challenges that made me an independent learner, dedicated to my aim of mastering the subject. For example, when my Pre-calculus class became challenging, I had to teach myself many of the concepts and find the solutions to the problems.  Often times, I would sit with my textbook and notes to work through problems and grasp a concept I couldn't understand.  I immediately noticed the results of my independent motivation, and I hope to diligently move towards my goals in order to achieve my dream of starting my own business. \\\\In addition to having my business, I have always dreamt of travelling the world. Specifically, travelling will be a way for me to immerse myself in different cultures and be able to explore new places.  My family and our love to travel has been a huge influence on this passion.  Every year, we travel locally, as well as internationally, which has accentuated my interest in foreign countries. Two years ago, we visited Germany, where I witnessed a lot of the history about the Holocaust.  On my trip to the Caribbean last summer, I observed the lifestyle of those living on the islands. Moreover, my family frequently travels to India to visit family. It is on these vacations that I witnessed the most lack of education: my motivation to help develop 1KID.  Vacations like these allowed me to become more cognizant about different places, and I plan to always continue learning this way. International experience will be a vital part of my career; it will allow me to become a global businesswoman.  \\\\Overall, my extremely resourceful world has influenced me to aim high and achieve great things. However, it has also made sure I do not forget about those who are less fortunate. I aspire to have a career in business where I can have diverse experiences and positively impact the world.\n",

      "\"I'm speaking with you today not to garner future votes but because I believe it's very important for all of you to get involved with politics. When I was in high school, I served as JSA's Southern California Lieutenant Governor because I was passionate about inspiring my classmates not only to vote for me in school elections, but to vote for actual politicians.\" As I sat in the large and imposing chamber of the US House of Representatives last July, listening to Congressman Mark Takano recount his beginnings in politics, I took a moment to reflect back on mine.\\\\A single quotation on the board at the beginning of my sophomore AP US History course first sparked my interest in American politics: \"Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves, and the only way they could do this is by not voting.\" After our class discussed Franklin Roosevelt's statement, we determined that that is exactly the issue in the world of American politics today: people aren't voting. By not participating in politics, people allow our government to make decisions that may serve a select minority, rather than the majority. To improve our political system, the majority of us, especially young people, need to be involved. As someone who comes from a religious minority, Zoroastrianism, and as someone whose family has faced significant oppression in Iran, I've long understood how important it is for a government to reflect its people's interests. With this class, however, I began understanding just how significant the problem of political apathy in America is, so I joined our school's Junior State of America (JSA) chapter.\\\\As JSA's Director of Activism for my school, I've focused heavily on increasing political participation through mock government elections and voter registration drives. As the 2014 California elections approached, we observed and discussed the gubernatorial candidates, their policies, and the state propositions. Watching my friends' faces light up as they actively debated policies--policies that would affect the very world they live in--was inspiring. Having learned about politics outside the classroom setting, they seemed so much more interested, and I felt more encouraged to get students involved in the political process. When they consequently registered to vote so they could translate their opinions to real-world polls, I knew I had impacted not only the political system but my friends' lives, as well.\\\\In an attempt to reach a wider audience, I coupled local activism with increased support for JSA as an organization. Since being elected Southern California Lieutenant Governor at the end of my junior year, my goal has been to increase the total number of students able to attend conventions. By spearheading expansion efforts in the Southern California JSA and increasing the total number of chapters to 116--the largest number of chapters nationwide--I've helped more students attend conventions, debate, and discuss political issues. Being able to bring political activism to students from schools across California by working at a broader administrative level has been just as rewarding as, if not more rewarding than, working with students individually at the local level.\\\\And now, here I am, on another JSA exploit, listening to Congressman Takano and having a former JSA member encourage me for a change. Listening to his beginnings, when he held the same position in JSA that I currently hold, inspires me to look to the next level of the political process: the national level. To further combat political apathy, I hope to one day run for political office to become more personally involved in the political process. As an active member of establishment politics, I would hope to effect change within government and lead national initiatives to promote political participation, taking further steps to address the perpetual problem of political apathy.\n",

      "I became very involved with the North American Federation of Temple Youth (NFTY) in order to connect more closely with my Jewish heritage. NFTY has influenced both my intellectual and spiritual growth. As an elected youth group leader at my home congregation, I was fortunate enough to participate in two summers at the Kutz Leadership Institute in New York. This opportunity allowed me to network with other teen leaders from across the country and exchange strategies to implement change in our local youth programs and educational activities. \\\\My time at Kutz inspired me to submit a new constitution for my local temple youth group. This undertaking was welcomed by both the teen membership and adult leadership and clergy since no review of our governing documents had taken place in over 20 years. In collaboration with a few of my peers in other cities, I have also helped to write an amendment for my NFTY regional constitution about allocation of voting rights among different chapters. Writing these official legislative documents reinforced how much I enjoy implementing necessary changes to improve the status quo. \\\\NFTY has also helped me to grow as a leader in many other capacities. It allowed me to develop the communication skills to reach out to people and interact with adult leaders. During my three years as a member of my temple youth group board in the positions of Membership VP, Programming VP, and currently President, I have learned to effectively deal with the different dynamics of each year's board. As President, I delegate authority while at the same time build consensus with those who may have strong opinions that differ from mine. \\Since pre-K, I have attended an Episcopalian school where Jewish students were in the minority. While the school embodies a tolerant and inclusive atmosphere, as I entered high school it became increasingly apparent to me that many of my classmates were unaware of Jewish traditions. As a result, in my junior year I submitted an application and was granted approval to start the Jewish Culture club. As President of the organization over the last two years, I have led the club's efforts to share information about Jewish culture, food, and history, which has helped promote understanding among a diverse group of students. \\\\My experience with NFTY and the Jewish Culture club has helped shape my interest in studying political science, public policy, and their relationship with economics. This interest has inspired me to participate in a Global Scholars program that my high school offers. Students who enroll in this program are required to take extra courses relating to global affairs and complete a capstone project on a global issue by the end of senior year (mine is about the multiple impacts of human trafficking in the Tampa Bay area). Watching the recent presidential debates and the news coverage of the different candidates has also piqued my interest in foreign affairs. While a career in government may not typically be what a high school student aspires to pursue, my \"dream\" would be to become Secretary of State where I would have the opportunity to influence all matters of international relations. An education in political science and economics will help me gain insight and entrance into this field.\n",

      "I attend Renaissance High School, a magnet school in Meridian, Idaho that offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. I pursued this program to challenge myself and prove that I am capable of earning the reputable status of an IB graduate. This program is only offered in two high schools in Idaho. While still continuing this two-year program, I have already noticed a significant transformation in my personality. This resulted with my intention to study college in a different state, as I was exposed to accepting various cultural perspectives as my own.?\\\\Students and faculty members in our school take great pride in the IB program. My graduating class contains 151 students, where about 70 pursue the program. Despite the small body of students, our teachers are proud of our dedication and wish to improve the yearly diploma achievement rate. Last year, about 82% of the IB students achieved their diploma, whereas this year's predicted success rate is 90%. Known as a rigorous program, the students are brought together by acknowledging this common struggle and creating a sense of community despite our individual differences.\\\\Most of my friends from the program are of varying ethnicities, such as Ukrainian, Caucasian, Asian, Indian and Irish. From them, I have gained insight on other cultures which has impacted me to adapt my lifestyle in relation to their varying values and beliefs. Because of this, a course within the IB program that is significant to me is anthropology, the study of culture. Part of the course statement is to study anthropological themes and theories within ethnographies, which could then be applied to students' perceptions on culture. Students also learn to be aware of various answers towards a question in which there are no singular answers. This is expressed through cultural relativism, where values of the culture is viewed through the perspective of the culture being observed, not through the observer's own cultural bias. This has allowed me to view social dynamics within societies. \\\\From this course, this knowledge can be applied towards different societies in Idaho, or even within different states. This is evident whenever I visit my extended family in California. We usually visit during the long holiday breaks at the end of the year. The drive to get there is about fourteen to sixteen hours, but my nuclear family chooses to drive to California because we don't have any other family in Idaho. To reunite kinship ties, we visit them for a week. Despite visiting for short periods at a time, seeing the differing lifestyles between Idahoan and Californian cultures has brought insight and caused me to aspire to study in California.\\\\Idaho has offered me so much already, but I believe that California holds further opportunities in regards to my education and being. I believe that my education in Idaho has set a strong foundation in which I could apply in a different setting, like California. The cultural diversity is greater in California whereas Idaho's Caucasian population is about 80%. In addition, Idaho has a smaller population and fewer large cities unlike California.  I believe that through the completion of the IB program, I have achieved the standards and expectations that Californian universities, specifically the UC system, hold towards students. Overall, my school has taught me to view the world in different perspectives and achieve greater.\n",

      "My world reflects my two fundamental and sometimes contrasting heritages and identities, and my lifelong endeavor to harmonize them.  My father comes from a long line of Muslim scholars and community leaders from Hyderabad, India, including both Sunni and Shia.  My grandfather was active in India's independence from Britain and championed the true Islam that equally respects both Muslims and Hindus.  I am also a direct descendant from the Prophet Muhammad.\\     I am also a direct descendant of the original Pilgrims that arrived on the Mayflower.  My mother, who became Muslim in college, descends from John and Priscilla Alden, and also Johnny Appleseed.  My great-grandfather helped write the Federal Labor laws during the Roosevelt administration.  My grandfather was a deep-sea diver in the U.S. Navy.  So it was ironic when my mother was told to \"go back to her own country\" in the days following 9/11, since few white people have roots in this land as deep as hers.  I myself have had peers make comments about \"those Moslems,\" as well as had teachers share Islamophobic articles in class.\\     Over the years I have thought a lot about how these identities relate, and how they relate in my life.  I concluded there is no conflict, in fact just the opposite.  Most of my world currently involves bringing together the Muslim worldview and the American worldview in a way that is both fully American and fully authentically Muslim.  As such, most of my extracurricular activities involve either helping explain Islam and Muslims to the general American society, or showing Muslims how to incorporate American values and adapt to the surrounding culture without losing their faith or way of life.  As a member of the Muslim Youth Board at my mosque, one of the largest in California, we not only participate in charitable services, but also discuss life as a Muslim teen in America and help show teens how to fully participate in our surroundings.  As president of the Sunny Hills High School Muslim Student Association, I provide support to students who are unsure how to follow their faith in a public school by speaking about Islam, providing a place to pray, leading prayers, and planning social activities with Muslims and non-Muslims.  I also volunteer at CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), a civil rights organization that teaches the American public about the American Muslim community while protecting their rights.\\     Today, I value how my unique ethnic and religious background has helped me create my own identity and has enabled me to interact with many different people.  At school, I am around predominantly Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian students.  At the mosque, I am surrounded by people from an extraordinary variety of races, from Arab to African to Indonesian.  On vacation, I am with my mother's white side of the family one day, and with my father's Indian family the next.\\     Over the years, I have come to realize that my rich, biracial heritage, religious background and diverse friendships have enabled me to interact comfortably with all types of people and to bridge many different worlds.  I am not certain of my future profession, but I am sure it will involve community-building.  Whether I pursue a career in history, education, political science, or law, I aspire to emulate my diverse ancestors and find a path that will enable me to unite people through our many similarities while celebrating our diversity.\n",

      "Growing up in a Chinese household in California, I was taught to uphold the cultural traditions that my family practices. My parents, who emigrated from Hong Kong in hopes of greater opportunities, raised me as they were raised, to value education at home and in school and to set ambitious goals. Although I had never been to an Asian country, living in the vibrant multicultural environs of the Bay Area I began to see the distinctions between Chinese and American cultures. However, I tended to follow both ideals separately in Asian or American company.\\\\Eventually, on a trip to Hong Kong to visit my grandmother in 2010, I saw that the two cultures could be productively combined after gaining perspectives from directly interacting with the Chinese community overseas. I arrived greeted by humid, one hundred degree weather and the bustle of thousands of people in the streets. With tall buildings looming down and seas of people around me, there was something different about the people my age.\\\\In Hong Kong, children are looked upon as maturing adults rather than growing children removed from adult society. This yields young adults who become responsible for their actions at an earlier age and who look to their peers for advice. During my first visit, I met a family friend who was my age. On a subsequent visit at the age of fourteen, I caught up with him and saw that he was remarkably mature and resourceful in his everyday life. He demonstrated an awareness of the value of consulting friends and family for academic support and to plan for his future, something I hadn't observed among my peers in California. For example, he spoke with great conviction and seriousness about his academic and professional plans. As a result of observing serious poverty and related welfare issues in his community, he wanted to study Public Health in college to become a social worker.\\\\This had an immediate impact on me. At home, I grew up facing problems independently and that outlook significantly changed once I truly understood the importance of community and collaboration in Chinese culture. People of my generation often fail to voice many of the most important issues they have and sometimes lack the initiative to plan ahead. However, after months in Hong Kong, I learned how more open communication enables an effective community approach to personal development and response to significant problems that may arise. Through my further exposure to Chinese culture, I now recognize the lack of communication and individual outlook of my millennial generation, and I instead strive to take a collective approach to achieving my goals and solving problems.\\\\In light of these experiences, I am now able to contextualize my upbringing in the Bay Area through the lessons that I have learned from Chinese culture. I have integrated the two cultures into my life and become motivated to continue to learn, socialize, and work in diverse international environments. I realize the value of being independent to achieve my dreams-to further my personal growth while earning a university degree and becoming a business professional-but I also appreciate cooperation with others. I hope to apply this outlook by collaborating with classmates while recognizing the benefits of independence and individual initiative. I want to impart the importance of cooperation in my fellow students because in our studies and our careers, we must work together as a global community. I am proud of the experiences that have contributed to who I am and I readily embrace my cultural identity in striving to better myself.\n",

      "The environment that one grows up in has a huge influence on their personality, whether they realize it or not. Being brought up in Singapore all my life has definitely had an effect on my dreams and aspirations. The most unique thing about the country of Singapore is how effectively it blends the Western and Asian culture to create its own unique identity.\\This mix of Western and Asian cultures has acquainted me with the best parts of both cultures.  Singapore being such an urbanized and developed country has made me more open to new opinions and ideas, and increased my international mindedness. However, being an inherently Asian country, I also learnt invaluable Asian values such as a degree of conservativeness, respect for others and the importance of family.  This culture blending has also allowed me to become more flexible in international environments, without losing my own cultural identity, and has in fact influenced my ambitions.\\The multiracial community in Singapore has also had a major influence on my outlook towards different people. As an Indian, Singapore's thriving Indian society is very important to me. Not only are we able to celebrate most of our major holidays as a community, but we also receive holidays for the most of the major ones like Diwali. This really holds a lot of significance for us especially since our indigenous festivals like Diwali and Holi are so widely recognized and celebrated. But one of the most special parts of living in Singapore is that we also get to celebrate festivals from other cultures. Consequently, despite being an Indian, I know exactly how and why Chinese people celebrate Chinese New Year and the significance of Hari Raya to the Malay. I am even considerably fluent in three languages - English, Hindi and French. This tolerant outlook that I have developed without compromising my own roots is another feature of my world that has prepared me to become a global citizen.\\The values that my family and community have taught me have also been very important in shaping my identity. Being an Indian away from home has, on the contrary, better connected me to my Indian roots. I have learnt a lot more about the Indian culture and way of life from my parents than I ever could have from living in India. Despite currently not learning Hindi, my mother tongue, in school, I speak the language fluently at home. All of these elements have made me aware of my roots and allowed me to become more internationally aware.\\The main implication of my upbringing has been the opportunity to be exposed to everything. Being able to combine humility with confidence and community with independence are things that I find the most unique about my world. Being in such a blended culture is what has allowed me to develop different aspects of my personality\\Living in a country as internationally linked as Singapore has also given me the opportunity to travel to a multitude of countries, having been lucky enough to explore several countries from Asia and Europe to countries in the Far East like Australia and New Zealand. I have even lived in and experienced the culture of Tanzania in east Africa, which is admittedly very different from the community in Singapore. Having experienced the atmosphere and environment of these various countries has made me more internationally aware and allowed me to grow as a more tolerant and open minded person.\n",

      "Schooling played a huge part in the development of my character.  My unique experiences in two drastically different schools shaped my personality today.  Pui Ching, my elementary school, is an elite local school with strong emphasis on Chinese tradition.  Enveloped by academic competitions in school as a small kid, I was motivated to study hard for every quiz, dictation and test.  I naturally embraced the school's values of industriousness and respectfulness, and gradually developed a sense of independence and diligence in my studies.\\\\Coming to the International Christian School (ICS) was culturally shocking.  My previous ideas of education and teacher-student hierarchy were entirely rewritten as I adapted to the American educational system.  Instead of keeping a respectful distance, I now develop frank and amiable relationships with teachers; instead of following textbook instructions and model answers faithfully, I now reflect my own opinions critically and honestly, for I grew to learn that \"there is no wrong answer.\"  Because ICS encourages students to speak their minds, I overcame my shyness and opened myself up.\\\\Pui Ching and ICS have very different educational orientations, but they are not entirely incompatible.  I have been very fortunate to learn the best of both worlds.  For instance, coming from a Chinese elementary school, I was lacking in English compared to my classmates who grew up in an English-speaking environment.  But with the discipline that was previously ingrained in me, I caught up in my first year and have continued to do well in school since then.  This successful experience turned me into a true believer of the wisdom, \"if there is a will, there is a way.\"  Doing well academically gives me the confidence to immerse myself in the ICS community, and to appreciate the values it represents.\\\\Because ICS strongly encourages students to serve the community, I was exposed to many opportunities to tutor middle school students and visit elderlies in local nursery homes.   After participating in several school service trips, I was inspired to organize a service trip to the Philippines during my junior year along with two other classmates.  In addition to planning the trip and coordinating activities among team members, I also managed a rather huge budget for the team of 37 people, which proved to be no simple task.  We will be leading the trip again this year with junior organizers, hoping that this will become an ICS tradition in which ICS students could become more involved in serving the needy.\\\\The service trip we organized not only raised awareness to poverty in third-world countries, but also inspired me to study in the field of accounting.  Being the one in charge of the budget, I was caught up with many complications in balancing the income and expenditures of huge sums, for the trip money went through a few bank accounts and changed hands for exchanging currencies.  Through first-hand experience, I realized that managing money requires a clear concept of financial transactions, accounting standard, and transparency.  To further explore this field of study, I took a summer college course.  Accounting is a promising field in China as its international business is expanding rapidly and its accounting practices need to improve.  Essential to an organization's survival, accounting plays an important role in society and is, notably, a career worth pursuing.  Indeed, without the service opportunities ICS has provided, I would have never had encountered this field of study.\n",

      "Growing up I was one of the happiest kids ever. I was always outside, playing with my sisters, and friends, enjoying life like every normal kid. Never did anyone see me unhappy. At the time I was seven years old, my older sister ten, and my youngest sister was four, we had both our parents living in the same house and life was great. As time went on, two of my cousins  moved in  with us, they gained all of our trust, and things were great for a while. One day my dad was running late to go pick up my younger sister Isabel from daycare and I wasn't ready so I asked if it was ok for me to stay with my cousin. My dad was hesitant about it but my cousin assured him that I'd be fine, so my dad let me stay. From that day forward my life changed forever. I was molested and threatened, by my cousin who was like a brother to me. I was told that if I ever told anyone about the things that went on,  my parents and sisters would be killed in front of me. At the time I didn't know exactly what was going on, but I knew what he was doing wasn't okay because it didn't feel right.  My mom would always tell me that if anything was going on to let her know, that no one should ever touch my body parts. I lived in fear that my parents and sisters would be taken away from me. He later moved out, and finally those horrific days were over, but I kept my secret with me for seven years. \\\\Life went on, but as time went on I became one of the angriest girls ever. I couldn't stand being hugged, touched, kissed, and rarely trusted anyone in my life. Anger continued to build up in me every single day and at one point I started to blame everyone and hated the world for what had happened to me. All I wanted was to have my childhood back and  to have good memories  but that wasn't going to happen. I later on reached out for help and got counseling and overcame all my obstacles with the help of my family, counselor and SOFTBALL.\\I joined a nearby softball travel team and let all my frustration and anger out on the field, and as soon as I stepped off the field I felt so much better. I played for a good two years and then I faced yet the BIGGEST obstacle in my life. During a game i had a bad play and injured my knee. This injury cost me many benched games, endless doctor's appointments to Valley Children's Hospital, and finally in the summer of 2014 I had my first knee surgery it was not successful.  Six months later I'd be having a second knee surgery, a surgery that would make me experience pain at a whole new level. I had what I believe is called a lateral detach,which is a surgery where your leg bone is cut shorter to make your kneecap rotate properly. The first words out of my mouth after surgery were\" I feel like I've been run over by a bus\"  alI I wanted to do was sleep and was not allowed to because of the reaction my body was having to the anesthesia and pain medication. It was causing my blood pressure to drop drastically and I was at risk of my heart stopping. Two days after surgery I was finally able to go home, but that's when my new  hell began. The pain was so severe I could not tolerate anyone touching my leg, and I couldn't even get up out of bed . Two weeks after surgery I returned to children's hospital for a checkup, and doctors could not understand why the pain medication I was on was not working. That is until they took my bandages off, my leg had severely bruised especially on my calf. Just to make sure everything was ok my doctor ordered an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot . Meanwhile all this is going on I was told I had to stay off my leg for another 6 weeks, I felt like I had  hit a brick wall. All I could think of was another season without softball, 6 more weeks of feeling useless not being able to bath myself, or even put on my own clothes I went home devastated.  Two months  after surgery I was finally able to get my cast removed and could start bending my knee again, I felt like the world was lifted off my shoulders. Now half a year later, 2 surgery, and endless drives to Valley children's every week for physical therapy, I have once again set foot on the softball field. That softball field that I love so much and has helped me overcome my childhood nightmare.\n",

      "My mom is guatemalan and my dad is salvadorian. They both raise me for well mangers and showing respect and fairness to others. Both of my parents are strict they aspect a lot from me. I'm always under pressure fro them. I'm the only child from my mom side. My dad has three other daughters from his ex wife. People knows me as a happy child, that enjoys making people smile and laugh and also always there for a person when it comes to problems. But in reality in my life  I never been happy. There was moment that I was but it never last. When I was little until the age four my dad came into my life he wasn't really around when I was smaller. I always seen him as a stranger but I gain my love for him little by little. At the age 6, he had an addiction to alcohol that's when things began to change. He began to beat my mother for the littlest things. There was times I would try to stop him and protect my mom but it was us less, he will beat be for protecting her then finish her until he was over the problem. Every moment was the same, I tired to keep a smile on my face to no one can know what's going on at home. There was a time I won't forget. It was late at night I was 7 years old I was watching Care Bears and my mom was in the living room then my dad came drunk as hell. I no longer remember what the argument was about but what I remember was yelling and screaming and my mom was yelling my name. I ran to the kitchen my dad was holding her from her neck and threating her with the knife I tired to stop him but he just hit me and told me to go to my room. And some how he was able to come down and just watch television. Since that day i always had love and hate for both my parents. Reason for my mom had suffer a lot from my dad but yet she continues to stay with him and my dad cause he was an ass whole to my mom and she always forgive him from his mistakes. In 2009 my dad became silver. Him and my mom decided to get marry and apologizes to her how he miss treated her throughout the years and of course my mom forgive him. Little by little my actions we're changing. My parents we're always arguing with me cause of my behavior was no longer the same. I told them how all the abuse affected me but they kept saying that I was stupid that it was in the past. In middle school I began to do drugs and thought there was no point for education. My relationship with my mom was no longer the same she was always in my back and I hated that. We tried going to counseling so we can have a better communication. It only help for about a week oh so then it was back the the arguments. Once it came to high school I change my actions and wanted a futures for myself. I tried my best to get good grades some times my parents thought I wasn't trying my best and then the arguments continues. Since I was getting older my arguments and fights we're mostly towards my dad. There was times he would compare b=me with his older daughter and which I hated to be compared with others. Then the arguments was leading to fights. He didn't like that fact how I was able to protect myself so he will beat me and I fight back. Just recently in October we got in a big fight he busted my lip and hit me several times in the head. I told my friends about and they suggested me to tell my counselor about it and I did. She never expected this was occurring in my life and I told the officer that works at my school and he ask me if i felt safe about it I said no, so he took me to the police station and called the social worker about it. She talk to me and then my parents and came to can conclusion my dad should leave the house until to be return. They decided not to take it to court cause I'm almost 18  and they wanted him to take anger management class which he has to wait to know when to go. He has return and we don't longer speak each other until I'm ready. I want to continue my education and have a major in Criminal Justice and be the first in the family to be in the FBI. Receiving the help can help me achieve my goal and soon help my family no matter what. And show them I made it\n",

      "I am wiser than many teens my age.  I am a young African American woman who has experienced many obstacles but did not and will not allow them to prevent me from rising to the top.  At the age of two, my twin and I were placed in foster care because our biological mother had too many children and unable to care for us.  We were placed in a couple of homes before we were placed in a home of a kind young couple.  They loved us unconditionally and decided to adopt us.  My life was changing for the better, but it still was not perfect.  \\At the age of six, my adopted parents divorced each other. There was no explanation given, it just happened. I remember being at my mom's in Antioch, waiting for my dad to come home. \"Mom, where is Daddy\", I asked her for the fifth time. She kept telling me that he wasn't coming home. I grabbed my favorite barbie blanket and pillow and went downstairs and waited by the door for my dad. My mom kept calling me upstairs to go to sleep, but I didn't listen to her. I just wanted my dad to come home. Since I wasn't listening to my mom, she called my aunt and my aunt told me that my dad wasn't coming home. I was crying and screaming for hours until I fell asleep by the front door. When I woke up the next morning, I was in my room and my dad still wasn't there. That's when my mom explained to me what was going on between them.\\Years went by and those were very tough years. They were tough because there was many transitions. We had to get used to our parents dating other people and living in different houses. I stopped wishing for my parents to get back together because I knew it was never going to happen, however, I still wasn't comfortable with my dad dating. I wasn't comfortable with him dating because I was used to having both of my parents together. Since my dad was moving on, my mom was too. My dad got married in 2007 and now we had a step sister and later on a little brother.\\My mom ended up moving to Brentwood for a couple of years and then moved to Modesto. I will never forget the house in Modesto. I will never forget it because on my10th birthday my mom told us that we were adopted. Now, I've always heard people saying that we were, but I didn't believe it. When my mom told us she started crying because she thought we would have been mad at her. I wasn't mad at her because she didn't do anything wrong, I was just disappointed and sad. Then I began thinking that everything was happening to me because I was adopted. Prior to those years, my dad kicked me out of his house because my stepmom said \"It's either me or her\". So surprisingly, he chose her. So for a month and half I stayed with my mom and I wasn't able to see my dad and I used to cry my eyes out all the time.\\    I was also disappointed and sad because my biological parents didn't want my brother and I for some reason. My mom told me that we had a lot more siblings that stayed with our biological grandma, but yet I wondered why we couldn't be with our biological grandma? Ever since I was told that my brother and I were adopted, I questioned a lot of things. I questioned myself, my parents, and my family. This was and still is to this day a very sensitive topic. I've always felt like my parents have had favoritism toward all my other siblings including my twin brother. I've had family members say to me \"I wish your dad never adopted you\" or \"Your dad should just take you guys back\". For some reason I would never cry when I heard those type of comments. I just let it go.\\    However, those comments and everything that has happened has made me into a very strong young women.  Even though I am very guarded and I don't show emotion, I don't let the negative comments get in my head because I am better than that. I repeatedly remember that \" I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\" (Philippians 4:13). I am ready to go to college and just become a happier person and learn a lot more. I've also learned that being adopted won't stop me from doing anything. If anything, I want to go to college, get a degree in psychology or criminal justice, graduate with my bachelor's, and then go find my family.\n",

      "Living through a Disease\\When I was five years old, my mother had been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer; she had surgery but it continuously reappeared until she got a double mastectomy when I was nine. I was jubilant that my mother was cancer free, I no longer had to watch her cope with the pain, and she was miraculously healthy again. Going through this at a young age taught me how life was taken for granted and could be seized at any time. Most kids do not have to worry about how many days they have left with their parents, but I did. I never knew what day would be the last with my mom, so I made the best out of every moment I had with her. Simple things like going out to dinner, or the car ride home were the moments when we talked the most. It was never awkward between us.  We always listened and enjoyed each other's company, no matter what the topic.\\The summer before my sophomore year of high school, my mother started complaining of back pains and decided to go to the doctor. They said she was fine, had to take it easy for a couple of weeks, and that she most likely pulled something in her back. She followed the doctor's orders but did not get better; the doctor decided to give her a MRI and the news that came back was not what anyone in my family expected. The cancer was back, stage 4 breast cancer which metastasized to her bones. The doctors gave her ten years to live. This news has been the hardest I have had to accept. My mom is my closest friend and knowing that she might only live ten more years was not only distressing but aggravating as well. She may never live to see my wedding day, or the births of her grandchildren. There are so many milestones that she will likely not be there for, and it has affected my personality and beliefs immensely.\\ I became serious, quiet, and almost mean to everyone around me partially because I did not know how to open up to anyone or share my feelings. I was so angry, this whole situation was unfair. All hope that I had for her living a long healthy life was gone. She was sick again, and my time with her was limited once more. Eventually, I told my AVID teacher who has helped me through this and I also began to open up more to my friends. They all have been so compassionate and kind, but the knowledge of my mom dying is hard to accept. \\The past couple of years have been the hardest of my life. Some days I would come home crying, worrying about how much time I would have left with my mom. She'd walk into my room and ask what was wrong, and as my eyes welled, I would tell her of how unjust the situation was, and how I did not want her to die. She would look at me with her big brown eyes, hold my hand and say, \"Sweetie, I'm still here, it is not going to happen today. Stop worrying about tomorrow, and start making the most out of the time we have now, and when tomorrow does come we will face that battle together.\"\\Ever since that day, when my mom saw that I was sad, she would say \"Not today.\" This reminded me not to worry so much about the future and live in the moment. Watching my mom deal with her disease shows me how I need to push past my uncertainties. I have become more independent and secure with who I am. I still have hard days, and sometimes I am just upset, but I don't let it stop me from moving forward and making a difference in other people's lives, like my mother did in mine. I share time with others, get to know their stories and try to help them push past their doubts. I listen to the struggles of their lives and remind them that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that they can overcome any situation they face, and that I will always be there for them. My mom has given me so much strength; not only have I helped others, but I work hard in school and don't let small disappointments stop me from accomplishing anything. I try my best to make my mom proud by working hard no matter what. I am not grateful that my mom has this disease, but I am thankful for the person I have become; outgoing, honest, determined, courageous, independent, confident, and brave.\n",

      "I come from a small city called Santa Cruz in California. It doesn't have much, but I still love it. But I'm definitely ready to move on to a big city. One of the biggest events in my life in a way it made me a stronger person and made me realize how childish and immature I had been. I never knew the real story to my parents separation and never clearly understood or cared over what happened and all my life until that event i always blamed my father for being the one to leave us and chose the bottle over his kids. One thing I did learn in 7th grade was that if I wanted to prove people wrong I had to do anything to be successful and happy, and so I'm very ambitious. One of my main goals in life is to be able to prove my mother wrong because she always told me I would end up homeless or cleaning houses, like herself, but for my sister's house. In a way this has shaped me to become a better person than my mother but also to not give up on my dreams just because someone tells me I can'tt or will never do it. In summer after my 10th grade my life changed. In the beginning of summer my friend started coming over all the time and after a while my mother got used to it until a month before school started. My mother did not like that I was transferring schools but she knew that is what I wanted even before I started high school, I wanted to go where all my friends were going but my sister didn't and since she was older she got first pick and went to a different one so I had to go there too.My mother was unhappy with those events so she basically kicked my friend out so I told my mother if she wanted her out I would leave too and and so she kicked us out. I called my father 7 days before school started to go pick me up. My father was in with not letting my friend live with us because he thought she was a bad influence when in reality I knew it was me. We were really poor and he didn't like the idea that a friend of mine would come over and take our food even if she did not. the house was no longer filled with food, we only had a few things in the fridge and when it was a little bit more full it was because i had gone to Dollar tree, a few blocks away, to buy frozen food and snacks. That week before school started my friend and I went to live with my father because my father finally met her and realized he was wrong on judging her before even knowing her. Having to live with 5 of my fathers family members in a 2 bedroom apartment with one bathroom, knowing that they did not like me or my friend, was horrific. Three months after living with my father we had to leave the apartments for having too many people living there. The most painful thing about our family was when all those 5 family members tried finding a place they didn't worry/care or include us in it. We were left on the street, again. We had nowhere else to go and apartments were being sucked up quickly, so we asked my godmother if we could stay with them for a few months and she let us. I knew that when a month ended I would cry at night knowing it was getting closer for us to move out and find a new place to live. Going back to Santa Cruz High school helped a lot because I had two very supportive friends. While living with my godmother my father promised we would move out by the end of March. In March it was my birthday and I still remember my birthday wish and it makes me tear up every time i remember it because I thought about how normal kids would wish for some expensive item while all I wished for shelter. My wish didn't come true, March ended, we moved out and my father stayed with a friend and I stayed with a girl I knew from school. I was so thankful she let me live with her. The girl's family was not perfect but she was just so lucky to have what she had. The happiest day of my life was when I was at school and received the best phone call ever. My father called me telling me that he received a call from some apartments near my school and that they were ready to let us move. This event has taught me that I know I want to have a house in the future and make programs that will help others find homes so they won't have to go through the same. And now i feel like Beyonce because \"my aspiration in life is to be happy.\"\n",

      "At one point everyone has to go through hard times in their lives. I've faced so many obstacles, but I faced one that changed mine and my family's entire life. My dad is the only one in the house that works. He's been working hard to give us a better life. He wants to make sure that my little sisters and I get a good education. \\      The life I have now is thanks to my parents. They've raised me to be a good, determined, generous human being. They've taught me that life isn't always easy and to never give up. My dad still tells me how giving up isn't going to solve problems and that it won't help me in life. He always says that in order to become someone in this world I have to follow my dreams and fight for what I want. My dad is my motivator; I look up to him because he's a hard working person. Seeing how much he struggles motivates and encourages me to work harder so I can give back everything he has done for me.\\      I seriously thought we were a happy perfect family, that nothing bad would ever happen to us, but I was wrong. Three years ago my life completely changed, my family wasn't the same. One night my dad was coming home from work and before going home he stopped by my uncle's job. My uncle offered him one beer and he took it. On his way home he got pulled over by a cop; he was arrested and charged with a DUI. My dad called and he told us what happened. The next morning my grandpa and my uncle went to the Van Nuys Jail to get more information on my dad's case.\\      Later that week he was transferred to the L.A county jail. He was there for three months; he said that prison isn't a place where human beings should be. He wanted to get out of there, so without his lawyer's concern he signed some documents. The same day he signed the documents he was deported and sent to Tijuana, Mexico. When we heard the news I couldn't believe it. I felt that it was unfair because the judge didn't pay attention to my dad's case; the judge didn't take in consideration what we had to say and how this was going to affect our family. That night he was deported I cried myself to sleep. \\      As time passed by I was getting used to the fact of my dad not being around. I was so depressed. My mom was struggling; we barely had enough money for anything, she had to pay bills, sometimes she wouldn't have enough money to feed us. My mom is the strongest bravest women I know, I don't know what we would have done without her. My dad was still in Mexico and he found a place to live in, he got a job. It was hard not having him with us, we missed him so much. Holidays were the worst, holidays are meant to spent time with your loved ones and we didn't have that. I felt that my dad suffered the most during this time of our lives. He went through everything, he was all alone without any family, sometimes he didn't have enough money to eat, he was kidnapped and he also had money stolen from him several times.\\      Throughout these terrible years in my life I didn't imagine myself going to college. Since there wasn't enough money I wasn't sure if I was going to go. I kept telling myself that instead of applying to college I would be applying to fast food restaurants to help my mom. Slowly I started giving up on school, my grades were dropping. My mom noticed and she told my dad. My dad called me and he told me not to give up, to try my best because he wants to see me succeed. He said if I care for him to not give up. I changed because I want to make him proud and I want him to know I'm not a quitter. \\      My dad was able to cross the border after three years. We were happy and relieved because we knew all our worries were going to be solve. I would've never imagined myself applying to college. I was sure that instead of applying to college I would be applying for jobs. This life experience changed my life for the better because it made me into a stronger person and I'm okay it happened because if it didn't I would have not been the person I am right now.\n",

      "As a child my mother was never present, she was always busy working or hanging out with her friends after work on Saturday nights. My brother and I were raised by my grandmother emotionally but financially by my mom. While my grandmother taught us values and rules my mom held a roof over our heads. My mom forgot we also needed her presence. There came a point where I viewed my grandmother as my mother and my own mother as a stranger. In her job my mom met a man who she fell in love with deeply.\\This man convinced her to quit her job and move in with him, my mom accepted. When she gave us the news I felt devastated, I was seeing what was known as safety to me being taken away; my grandmother would no longer live with me. At first it was a hard transition to live with someone I didn't spend much time with; at most I spent two hours a week with my mom, the only one I had left was my brother. As the months went by I got accustomed to my new life, everything was perfect. Until the man my mom fell in love with showed his true colors. \\This man was aggressive emotionally and physically. He would constantly physically abuse my mom and his daughters for any little reason. The tortillas were burnt, a slap; they overslept, hair wrapped in his hands and thrown to a wall; those were the images I lived through every day. My mom would always leave yet crawl back to him with my brother and I behind her. She was losing her dreams. We lived unbalanced for three years. There was a day my mom did something that unpleased him and he started hitting her, I was outside and when I came inside the house I heard my mom screaming so I ran to the room. \\When I opened the door I saw my mom on the floor and he was kicking her, at the time she was pregnant with his child. My mom started telling me to call the women who rented a room in the house, Dona Maria, but the man said if I did he would kill her and he got her and the knife near him and held it to her neck, as a 2nd grader I froze and couldn't stop crying. My brother was the hero that day and he was only a 1st grader, he ran to the woman's room and called her. That wasn't the end; my mom was still not seeing her dreams clear. It wasn't until he threatens her to beat my brother that my mother woke up. \\That was the point my mom saw her dream of her children having a better future than hers being questioned and with all the fear in the world she fled. That was the last time we lived in the house of terror. Even though my mom was losing her dreams she saw a glimpse and reacted in time; she taught me that even if it scares you for the ones you love, your family, you do anything to keep them safe and pure. \\There was a time where I stopped believing in myself. Anything negative wasn't allowed in our family, it didn't exist anymore. After my mom's changed mentality and becoming a Christian she saw no problems in life, which meant we were supposed to think like that. I had bottled so many emotions, that one day in 8th grade they spilled and I fell into a depression. I saw no point in living anymore, my strength and my wall had fallen down. I was not only dealing with depression I was also developing an eating disorder; I was destructive to myself. With time I received help and overcame my destructive ways and now my future is clear and I am able to live a healthy life. Now I know that everything in this life has a purpose; because of my experience I developed a great desire in my heart to help children and teenagers who go through what I did. Everything that occurs in our life is either to learn a valuable and necessary lesson or to be able to understand those around us with a humbler heart. We are human, and we fail. That's why I am not perfect and it's amazing to accept it and only be me, the best part my experience lets me.\n",

      "Growing up as a foster youth and getting adopted has always been a challenge for me. I knew who my mother was and I wasn't disconnected from my family, but I never knew why I had to be a foster child. Information on why I was taken away from my mom was always kept a secret. As much as it affected me, I never tried letting it affect my school work. Getting an education had always been important to me. \\When I moved to with my aunt who is my guardian, I felt like I lost \\everything. I was never kept away from my mom. I would always see her every weekend. After I moved, things changed. The closest thing I had were only  phone calls. Life took a toll on me. My education went down the hill and I missed seeing my mom. It took months for me to get used to being a thousand miles away from my mom. When I finally got used to a new environment, I thought of some ways I could stay with my mom. I talked to my aunt and asked if it was alright if over the summer I could live with my mom, she approved it. When I moved with my mom, I realized I needed to focus on school. I knew life was beginning to change for me, living with my mom was a great start to change my life around. I started high school off as a confused freshman, afraid of not making any friends and being lonely. I didn't let my fears get the best of me, I walked around school introducing myself to my peers hoping I get a positive response, and I did. Although my social life freshman year was great, my grades weren't as great. I was too focused on making friends, Instead of making good grades. At that time, my grades didn't bother me so I continued worrying about the\\wrong thing.When summer came, I had summer school for failing two classes. I was upset because I had to cancel my summer plans and instead go to summer school. Then I realized, I should not be upset because it was my fault for having to take the two classes over. I went to summer school for four weeks, and I can say it was the toughest four weeks of my life. It was a challenge trying to fit a whole semester of learning into only four weeks. Although, it was hard trying to learn a Semesters worth of work in only two weeks for each class, I passed both classes with an \\A and a B After summer school, I learned I did not want to be in that same situation again so I will need to focus on my school work and work harder. Sophomore year, I was focused on two things and this time it was getting good grades and also making friends. I worked hard to pass each class. That way I would be putting myself in a right direction of not taking any class over. I did not fail any class sophomore year, but I was not happy with my work. I realized I needed to focus on one thing and that is my education and not friends. I knew I needed to make changes about myself, in order to do the right thing. Junior year came, I was more focused on my education and I did not want anyone or anything stopping me from learning all of the materials I need in order to graduate. Junior year was a bit hard because I had eight classes that I needed to pass. I did struggle from time to time and I did pass all of my eight classes, I thought I never would pass. I never believed in myself passing eight classes, and I did. I got honor roll for maintaining good grades and having a 3.67 GPA for the semester. I was so proud of what I accomplished and I wanted to continue working hard. It is now my senior year! This is not anytime for making friends or failing any classes. I have been making sure I am on top of my grades every day. I will not accept anything lower than a B. I want to get honor roll again, except I want to get honor roll for having a 4.0 GPA. I have never gotten straight A's or a 4.0 GPA, I am doing everything I can reach that goal.\n",

      "At the age of two my family decided to move to Mexico but it didn't work out, i left Mexico to start a new life with my family in the United States, it was obvious that i wasn't that different than other kids in school. I made so many friends and i was just happy i wasn't alone even though i was a little girl.\\\\In the world i come from there is different types of people, some are great some are just ordinary people. Such as my family, I have a great family. My family is always supporting me at everything. They notify me to let me know that to never give up to what i want to achieve. We have struggles, but my family still manages to go through the struggles. Me and my family been through so much, such as like me losing my uncle was really bad. It got in my way in school, and it was like i lost my best friend. It was the worst day of my life. He was the one that i would go to every time i had a problem in school. The one i can depend anything on. I was doing really bad in school because all i would think about was him, because i lost someone really special in my life. Then, i started thinking that he's still by my side at all times and i know he doesn't want me to make mistakes in school. Now it still impacts me but i still manage to go through it, what keeps me going more and more is me thinking about him and my uncle telling me i can do anything i want and to achieve my goals and be a different person, and mainly just be someone in life. I've learned a lesson after all of the things that happened because i messed up in school by thinking of my uncle so much but then i was getting more focused at school, i knew i was messing up. Also, even though you lose someone that is very important to you just try your best to focus on what is ahead of you because that person is looking down on you watching you achieve for dreams.\\\\MY short term goals are seeing myself in college getting my bachelors degree. Its going to take atleast 4 years, but i'm going to try my best at getting it. I just hope that nothing goes wrong and i'm not going to give up at all. My family depends on me now since i am the youngest. I'll achieve this goal in college by doing good in my classes and just focusing more in school. I'm not going to let anything get in my way. My long term goal in ten to twenty years is already becoming a doctor or surgeon and having a family, it's going to take time for me to be one of those things, but i'm willing to go after my dreams. My dreams have influenced me by many things. Such as my brother, he's been through so many surgeries since he was a little baby and he's still struggling now and his surgeon is trying his very best to help him through the rest of the surgeries he's having. That has gave me a feeling of blithe, because everytime he gets out of his surgery he's fine. That is why i want to be a surgeon i want to help save people's lives and make their family happy. Another thing is there is so many little kids out there that are really sick and some of them need immediate surgery, and that makes me sad because some kids can't get surgery and i would want to help them get even though if they have to pay for their surgery i can help them also. This motivates me by being a surgeon because i care about other people's lives because i know how it feels to lose a person, or a little child. All of this relates to my success in college because i'm going after my dreams, and i'm not going to stop till i get closer and closer. I'm just looking at what's ahead of me. \\\\In conclusion, i'm going to go after my dreams whether it takes time. I want my family to know they can depend on me at all times and know that their little girl can make them happy by being what she wants to be when she grows up. MY success is measured by the strength of my desire; the size of my dreams; and how i handle the disappointment along the way.\n",

      "Life is not as it is expected to be. Sometimes, it can be easy and sometimes it can be hard but we have to make the best out of it regardless of the obstacles. \\My mom began feeling sick during early 2012, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and it affected me. During her struggle to fight the cancer I prefered not to go to school because I wanted to be with my mom and never leave her side. My mom knew that I was worried about her but she always reassured me not to worry about her because she was going to be ok, all she wanted me was to focus on school and get good grades. My mom started getting chemotherapy and radiation in March 2012. It was a tough time for me to watch my mom suffer and change physically, watching her hair fallout, her being depressed and I felt hopeless because there was little I could do but reassure her and hug her. Then came one of our happiest moments of our lives, the doctors told my mom she was cancer free and she was so happy and cheerful. It was like God had given her another chance. My mom was so happy it totally changed her she was always dressing beautiful and most important living life to the fullest. We had an amazing Thanksgiving and Christmas Day ever. Then the bad news arrived that her cancer came back and that she only had two months to live. I can't explain how upset and disappointed I was at that moment. I felt like the world caved in and I could barely breathe, my mom would soon pass away. My mom decided she wanted to return to Mexico to spend time with her mom. A few days later I went too. Luckily I was able to arrive in Mexico just in time to see my mom before she passed away. But, she was so sick she could not recognize me and on March 28 2013 my mother passed away. I thought to myself what am I going to do now? Then I remembered she told me \"always go to school no matter what happens\". I overcame her passing by thinking that she is not suffering from cancer any more and is resting in peace.  Upon returning to school, I had to get all my missed assignments and keep up with my work, so my teachers worked with me and I was able to raise my grades and make honor roll. My sister allowed me to live with her but she lived an hour walk away from high school. But, I had to overcome that distance, I got rides from family members, took the bus and sometimes walked. My mom didn't raise a quitter so I kept doing my best to go to school. I had the CAHSEE and didn't study because of what happened so I took after school and Saturday studies. Sometimes my sister tells me that she hates herself for not being able to buy me good school supplies, a new backpack, new school uniform or even give me money to go out and have some fun with my friends. The good thing is that I'm not that type of person that worries about how old my cloth is or looks or if my school supplies are cheap but what i do worry about is that who will pay for my college and the stuff I will need for college, paying for college tuition and I always hear college kids complaining about the cost of books.  I do not like the feeling of relying on others. I told my mom of my dreams and I will be the first person in my family to attend college. I just get the feeling that something special awaits me on graduation day. My financial situation affects me but like they say when there is a will there is a way and my will will lead my way. Even though the obstacles that affected me I know for a fact that any obstacle that gets in my way I could confront it and overcome it. One day I hope to look back and say \"mother I thank you for raising me to be a great man and for that now I am that engineer I always promised you I will end up being.\" That  was a promise I made and I will not give up no matter what!\n",

      "First, I begin by scanning the sheet of paper, looking for starting place. Then, I carefully place pencil to paper. Sometimes I'll use extra colors like black or blue; G2 pens are my favorite (they glide so smoothly across the page). Each product finishes as a messy collage of colored lines regardless of the inspiration. If I'm successful, I'll end up admiring an elegant result, but if I'm stuck, lots of paper will be crumpled up and thrown away. Mathematicians are quite liberal in their use of scratch paper. Such is the nature of the world of competitive math.\\  In my experience, I've seen different types of math, including \"calculator\" and \"contest\" math. Calculator math is boring; it's the structured, algorithmic math that screams for calculator use to simplify numerical nightmares. Calculators can carry out Herculean tasks but they cannot be programmed to be creative. But contest math is distinct from calculator math. Contest math is characterized by questions whose solutions require creative approaches -- an innately human ability. Whether competitive or as a hobby, contest math presents unique challenges ranging from algebra and number theory to counting and geometry. Of the two, contest math is more challenging, more engaging, and more fulfilling. This is my creative outlet; while others may write poetry or develop iPhone apps, this has been my world since middle school.\\Patience. Grit. Intuition. Perhaps these are not words that immediately come to mind when discussing math, but these are the demands contest math make. A typical problem can take between a handful of seconds to several days to solve. Along the way, nine-variable equations and other monsters may rear their heads. Although they hardly register as pivotal steps in the solution, these beasts serve as tests of endurance rather than measures of difficulty. And lastly, in a field strictly defined by axioms and theorems and characterized by rigorous logic, some of the best solutions can be entirely offbeat. Creative license can be taken to find an adequate solution.\\Creative problem-solving. That's the most important perspective I've gained from contest math. Spending time and resources (such as scratch paper) to develop a novel approach is a worthy investment, especially when conventional techniques may lead to exercises in futility. Results require risks. The best results, of course, are those that can be repeated, as opposed to one-time fixes. From adding hang time to my jump shot to evade taller defenders while playing basketball to making a cone amplifier out of posterboard for physics class to building a Rube Goldberg machine for my Science Olympiad team, I've learned to look for imaginative solutions over uninventive ones. They work over time too, with every pick-up game, every song, and every tournament. But they couldn't be found without the blocked shots, the broken speakers, or the machine's bungled steps. As with contest math, the solution is the product of multiple imperfections.\\My interest in contest math has formed the backbone of my identity as a problem-solver. It has provided a fulfilling venue to grapple with unfamiliar adversaries on a regular basis. That's what contest math shares the most with the world as a whole: the nature of their problems is unprecedented and unpredictable. Many of today's challenges cannot be solved through conventional means but, rather, require new ideas. Tomorrow, I might take a crack at peak oil or unequal access to water, carefully sketching a plan as I press pencil to paper. Whether I hit or miss, whether I admire an elegant result or crumple the page to start anew on a separate sheet, I'll be willing to take risks to search for even a single clue. But for today, I'll practice with polynomials and triangles.\n",

      "My most precious possession is a photo album. Between the dusty covers are pages and pages of pictures showing me with my robots. My passion for innovation started with a childhood fascination for nuts and bolts. The photo album records every step along the way to where I am now -starting with old black and white blurry shots and progressing to clear color pictures.\\The first photo in the album shows a little kid standing next to his simple toy car. Model cars were popular among boys, and every afternoon my friends and I would gather around a model car racing track to compete with each other. This activity with my friends was not enough. I was more interested in the car as a machine. A true machine should be more sophisticated, I thought. I began to spend many afternoons in the garage, working on my own creation -- a car that is smart enough to operate on all types of terrains. I designed every detail to make the car real and unique, sand papering the surface to round the corners and make it all even and smooth, and adding color coating to give it a metallic look. When I took my car to the playground, it instantaneously became the center of attention. I was 10 years old and so excited to have created this innovation that was so different and cool. \\Flipping through the pages of my album, I see a more recent photo. In the photo, the teenage me is pondering over a robot prototype. When I entered middle school, I naturally joined the Robotics club. For the first time, I had an instructor and started to learn the subject systematically, working on a project. The more I learned about the sophistication of functionality designs, the less I focused on the appearance of the robot. To make a robot that can replicate some human functions, wrapping the body of the robot with fake silicone skin would not help achieve the goal. In my project, Bumper Switches were installed around the body's hands to detect collisions and trigger reactions similar to those of humans. Ultrasonic Sensorswere put on the head to survey the landscape and determine the distance between the robot and an obstacle. The project had no deadline, so I kept experimenting with complex but more precise methods and components. Innovation to me, then, was to design sophisticated functions. Artists can design the look, but it is the engineers' responsibility to innovate and achieve the utmost function. \\Later in the album there is a whole section of photos of me at competitions. The object of one competition was for the robots to lift blocks of wood from the floor and drop them into different baskets. I had spent years designing my robot to perform all type of tasks and this competition would present no problem. However, once I started testing my robot, I saw the problem immediately -- although the design was sophisticated enough to allow the robot to perform the lifting and dropping, it was not a very efficient design. I had spent many nights designing the two legs to work like human legs, but caterpillars would be more suited to navigate a rugged path. Human like arms perform functions but conveyor belts would certainly pick up the blocks faster. After much trial and error and subsequent  redesigning, my robot looked drastically different from the one I started with, but every function that remained served a specific goal of increasing the speed and accuracy of picking up and dropping the wood blocks. This experience taught me an important lesson about innovation -- every robot design should serve a specifically defined goal and in this case, the purpose was to perform the lifting and dropping.\\Robots have accompanied me through my childhood. There is still plenty of space left in the album and more photos will be added in the future, with more robots and machines that will surely show the results of my increasing understanding of the meaning of innovation.\n",

      "Blood drips down the stained x-acto knife. My hands slip in the middle of cutting thousands of tiny hexagons from vinyl paper... for the third time tonight. I grab a bandage and toss the wrapper into the pile with all the others and carry on. I will not allow clumsiness to intimidate me.  With a ruler and bloodshot eyes, I peel each sticker and meticulously paste them one-sixteenth of an inch apart on a hexagonal jar. I coat the glass jar with four thin layers of sticky, yellow spray paint, then use a needle to stab each sticker to peel it from the jar. Another hexagonal pattern reveals itself just like that. I proceed to shed a couple more drops of blood before completing the task. Dipping a q-tip into nail-polish remover and rubbing the jar free of my DNA, I finally marvel at the culmination of six iterations of failed designs. Although my hands burn as the acetone stings my cuts, it's all worth it holding up my final mock-up of Beeleaf.\\\\Beeleaf, a do-it-yourself hot beverage kit that includes tea leaves and honey for a soothing drink at home, was the first prototype I had created for my arts and marketing portfolio. Inspired by the mathematically uniform hexagonal patterns of honeycombs, I designed this honey green tea kit to reflect simple, natural beauty. However, within the aesthetics lies function as well. The warm, inviting colors paired with an ergonomic hexagonal design and minimalist infographics create a seamless consumer experience. \\\\You see, ever since I was a little girl, television advertisements captivated my attention almost as much as the Saturday morning cartoons they interrupted. From the almost humorously bland QVC commercials to high budget Hershey animations, I instinctively noticed a fine line between tasteless and effective advertising. QVC segments presented the same direct, monotonous dialogue, appealing to rational reasoning but nothing else. On the other hand, Hershey ads allowed its audience to live vicariously through extravagant stories. The chocolatey wonders it contrived paired with catchy melodies transported me to a world bettered by Hershey kisses. After all, the most simple beauties of life are often experienced without forgoing either luxury or practicality. \\My passion for meshing form with function spilled over to a design project during the University of Pennsylvania's Summer Architecture program. Tasked with creating a bike repair shop that could withstand wear and tear of Mother Nature, I envisioned a mobile shed that would fuse the beauty of an art installment while performing repairs. In Philadelphia, ordinary bike repair stores are commonly tucked away between rows of stores, emphasizing speed and competitive costs above all else. But what does an extraordinary one look like? Inspired by utilitarian industrial architecture, but deciding to throw in a space-age material twist, I first included small windows that lit up the shed. Then, I designed the frame to be split open into two mobile sections that sat at both sides of a pathway, not only allowing customers to drop off their bikes with ease, but also for passersby to admire the bodywork of the shed and its occupants. With a curved roof, long cylindrical supports, and a surrounding garden, my mock-up stood stood tall as a stable refuge against the summer sun, the autumn breeze, the winter snow, and the spring showers. \\\\The difference between designers and artists lies within their contrasting purposes. Artists express their ideas and emotions freely while designers must restrain themselves in fulfilling specific tasks. However, when a designer caters purely to functionality, the end product becomes rigid and often dull. Surely, a sense of purpose is paramount, but creativity is often stifled in this pursuit. Without foregoing utility, I seek to reinforce \"form-and-function\" by achieving the same artistic impressions that encourage skepticism and evoke strong emotions. While creativity and functionality are rarely intermingled, I want to prove that when they do, beauty results.\n",

      "The lights blink on, as they wash over the stage. Illuminated, there's nothing but the soft 'ba-dum, ba-dum' of my nervous heart. The slightest sounds are jarring in the silence. We wait. 'Ba-dum, ba-dum.' Gradually, the speakers hum to life, and a soft melody floats out and finds me. I begin to move. \\\\This is pop and lock, a form of hip-hop commonly mislabeled as \"dubstep dancing.\" Suddenly, the muscles in my right arm clench and relax, a hit to the beat of the snare and the drum. My fingertips rise and fall, as a gentle breath of life travels up my left arm, making each segment pulse in turn: isolation, fine-tuned with hours and hours of practice to create this illusion of a wave. I continue, seamlessly flowing in and out of each move, transitioning from segment to segment, making the musical melody my own.\\\\As the tempo quickens, I hand the dance off to my partner. Frozen in place, I realize that my anxiety has silently slipped away. The beat shifts again, and the dance returns to me. The audience remains silent as I tweak each move from before in slight variations, forming different combinations. My mind is constantly calculating, exploring the numerous sequences I can create. My dancing comes alive. \\\\Walking off stage after the song, there's a tingling sensation in my chest, no longer stemming from a strangling anxiety but from the exhilaration of innovating and creating freely. A battleground for dancers is a field of endless possibilities difficult to find elsewhere, as each dancer develops a unique style. Nonetheless, I believe that I have found another outlet for my desire to innovate, STEM.\\\\Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, teleportation, all aspects of the sci-fi, the impossible, which may one day be reality. This is what is amazing about STEM. Like dance, the possibilities are almost endless. As scientists today are constantly making discoveries in a variety of fields, what seemed like the unattainable yesterday has suddenly become possible. I have grown up in this age of unmatched progress and want to be a part of the new technological revolution as humanity progresses towards the future. To do so, I have already begun the process of training to become such an innovator.\\\\Ever since the seventh grade, I have kept a record of ideas and fleeting thoughts which have entered my mind: an app which could turn any smartphone into a mouse by utilizing the sensors within and connecting it to a laptop through bluetooth, headphones which communicate the number of decibels that the user is experiencing to help aid in the prevention of hearing loss, the list goes on.\\\\Some of these ideas, I have tried to make into reality. My science fair project from last year, Picasso Bot, is a robot with basic artistic abilities which draws randomized squares and circles of varying sizes around an existing picture, forming a unique composition. Another project that I am currently undertaking is the creation of a music discovery website called Currents. However, during Current's development, I realized just how lacking my technical skills were. As a result, I have been studying HTML/CSS, Python, Javascript, and Java, but I recognize that I have only begun to scratch the surface of the technical aspects. \\\\In the future, I hope to be an entrepreneur in the tech industry and develop new technologies that will change our world. However, to do this requires more than innovation and creative thinking, advanced technical skills, which I hope to acquire more of in college, will also be necessary. Furthermore, unlike in dance, where there are very few restrictions, science has many fundamental laws that I must firmly understand before developing ways to make the impossible possible. With a degree in engineering, I will become more than a dreamer. I will be an inventor.\n",

      "Though I am a professional pianist, growing up at the Bavarian National Theater, where my father was music director, has caused my world to be greatly shaped by opera. With its capacity to inspire both emotion and imagination, opera has nourished me.\\\\One production particularly stands out: Wagner's Ring Cycle as staged by Andreas Kriegenburg. The Cycle centers on a magical ring with maleficent features: it gifts its owner with absolute power, but eventually annihilates him.\\ \\Rheingold, the first of the four operas that constitute the Ring Cycle: a bell rings three times, the lights dim, the conductor enters the pit, the audience grows hushed. The orchestra plays the opening in the dark. Intricate, interlaced chords convey disgust, anguish and love. The harmonies of each dense chord dig into our psyches and our souls.\\\\Time is suspended. The flying notes seem to freeze as they express eternal themes - problems of dread and longing that have tormented every generation of humans since the dawn of mankind.  The intensity of the score strips me of my defenses, leaving me vulnerable and trembling before its power. I revel in this sensation and in the music's ability to stop time. Too often, as time is precious and feels scarce, I cannot bring myself to use it reflecting on my emotions.\\ \\The curtains open, revealing hundreds of nude figures painting themselves blue.  In pairs, they embark on a magnificent, sensual dance: undulating, they fervently wrap themselves around one another, moving together as a body of water. Accompanied by Wagner's theme on the Rhine, their erotic, wave-like gestures create a formidable effect, combining the power of the river and its magical gold ring with the element of seduction that reigns over the Cycle.\\\\I watch in uneasy fascination as the production unfolds its stark aesthetic. It employs no 3D effects, no extravagant decorations. Using only human bodies, precise movement, and a few hand-made costumes, Kriegenburg brings the production to life.  He gives us undiluted authenticity, perfectly coordinated with the music.\\\\A low, rhythmic motif sounds, heralding the entrance of two fearless giants. The singers climb onto massive blocks of crushed humans to sing their arias. Their bodies constitute only the heads of the giants; actors stand on top of each other to create arms and legs. In a matter of seconds, the giants' ruthless nature is conveyed.\\\\By pointing its finger at that which tempts us, at our hunger for power, and at our fear of death, the opera leads us on the most compelling journey of all: the exploration of ourselves. It concludes with the construction of a bridge to the majestic castle of the gods. A spectacular drum echoes through the theater as a god produces lightning to form the bridge. Actors carry aluminum-wrapped pieces of cardboard up an inclined stage and wave their makeshift mirrors at the audience, reminding us of our humanity. \\\\Opera provides an escape into a realm of emotional truth, allowing me to delight in discovering my own feelings. It has also shaped my aspirations to extend this revealing journey to all members of society. With its capacity to convey emotions that remain inexplicable despite the technology of our century, opera holds the power to bring inspiration and curiosity into anyone's life. In our modern world where so many elements are known and defined, I hope to drive individuals to keep exploring the unknown.\n",

      "The fundamental element that makes us, the human being, so powerful and so flourishing is our unique curiosity. That is, it is our willingness and passion to explore, to investigate, and to learn from our environment. My insatiable curiosity developed from my father, a retired mechanical engineer from China. \\\\Similar to most kids, I loved to play with car models and video games when I was young. My interest shifted, however, when my father handed me a special gift, a handmade electric generator, for my tenth birthday. With a coil of cooper wire wrapped around a cardboard box, the simple electric generator was able to light up a tiny bulb, when I gently rotated the magnet inside the box. \\\\\"How does it work?\" \\\\In response to his simple question, I decided to find out on my own. A moving magnet creates a changing magnetic field, which allows the electrons in copper wire to move along and enter the light bulb, causing the bulb to light. \\\\Although my naive mind could not fully understand the process, I was totally fascinated by the fact that even daily objects that appear to have no direct relationship, such as a magnet and a piece of copper wire, could be used to create such amazing results. In fact, I was impressed that this simple appliance was able to fully explain the fundamental concept of generating electricity. Ever since then, my curiosity, like an invisible hand, has driven me to explore the reasons behind all daily objects I have encountered. \\\\As I flipped through all the science related books I owned and searched online, I had not only found answers, but also something that is more valuable: a brand new vision of the world. I perceive the world no longer as I used to. Machines and tools are no longer magic; they work not because of what they are. They work because of the scientific concepts behind them combined with human creativity and wisdom.\\\\My father, who was pleased that my interest was related to his field of career, soon became my personal advisor. My favorite moments were when I followed him to work on the weekends. His workplace was my playground. More accurately, it was my out-of-school classroom. I would causally pick up a stack of blueprints from his desk, \"admiring\" every detailed drawing and wondering what each abbreviated letter represented. I would suddenly point at an unfamiliar machine and demand he tell me the concept behind it. Likewise, I would hand him my beloved Chinese version of the DK's Science Encyclopedia Series, urging him to interpret the text I did not understand.\\ \\Patiently, he found a good balance between the complexity of concept and the simplicity required for me to process the concept. While enjoying each of my father's thirty-minute stories, I was always astonished by how much he knew. I was proud of him. I wanted to be like him. I wanted to see the world the same way he did.\\\\Years have passed. Though my father's hair is white now, and his face is worn, his enthusiasm for science has never diminished. Our routine discussions still take place. Now, however, instead of merely listening to my father explain, I now lead the discussions, eager to share every piece of new information I have discovered.\\\\Curiosity is the fuel of learning, while knowledge is the foundation of innovation. My father's unique method of teaching aroused my curiosity, which has played an essential role in my learning process. Never satisfied with existing knowledge, I am motivated to seek new knowledge anywhere, at any time. Carrying this precious curiosity forward, I will continue to explore the rest of the mystical world.\n",

      "Virtually every weekend or summer day, I leap out of bed excited to code up games and apps. I have caught what my mother refers to as \"computer disease.\" However, computer programming has not always fascinated me like it does today. Observing my mother, a software engineer, gave me a distorted view of \"programming\" as just sitting and typing all day.\\\\A turning point occurred early on in high school. My enthusiasm for gaming led me to a 2-week programming camp on Apple iOS & Android games. I built my own 3D first-person shooter game with Unity and C#, and discovered my latent passion for programming. Seeing my creation move around the screen and explode into cartoon rings was addictive, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching my instructor struggle to beat my game. The keyboard had become more than that mere tool to produce text that used to repel me: it became the gateway through which I could teach computers the art of creation. \\\\Programming gratifies creative longings built deep within me and has fueled my passion for continuous learning. I would never have thought that programming could trigger the essence of my creativity. As I became more and more accustomed to the creative process of programming, the finesse of my programs increased. I prided myself in my creations. There were plenty of little projects such as a tic-tac-toe game for iPhone I made from scratch through Xcode. I completed more complex projects like 3D experiments with Scenekit. I always kept new project ideas in mind, constantly learning new techniques to implement and having my friends test them out. This phase of designing unique apps really challenged me to expand the levels of my creativity. Each game represented the work of my mind and fingers. Each executable program contained a bit of my soul.\\\\This summer, my experience at COSMOS' Sound for Mobile Devices: Physical Modeling and Programming widened the scope of my visions. Our project team created an awesome \"virtual aluminum can\" app that accurately replicates the sound of shaking a can filled with the user's choice of four materials: rice, pasta, water and salt. We also coded four container \"extensions\" to hold the virtual contents: plastic water bottle, plastic bag, glass bottle, and tin can. I learned many new aspects of application coding and research through this project. More importantly, I developed teamwork skills as I realized how much real-world industries require collaborative effort.  \\\\No real world problems fit neatly under the umbrella of one discipline and few can be solved by one individual. Programming presents teamwork challenges because many coders keep their eyes glued to their screens. At COSMOS, I found the way we edited each other's code in real time on GitHub very useful. I made plenty of tiny errors in my code for the gyroscope sensor, but my groupmates easily fixed them. Getting to know my groupmates was also a key element in our effectiveness as a team and meeting up every day was a great way to improve communication. Through collaboration, our team was able to accomplish the more advanced project than any of us could have alone.\\ \\Without a doubt, computer programming has been a dominant force in my life. It brings out the creative spark hidden in me and teaches cooperation. Through my lifelong programming experiences, I have developed such traits that I hope to continue to enhance. I desire to use my ingenuity and social skills in all aspects of my life. By thinking originally, I know I can explore unprecedented grounds, and I've experienced how using my creativity in collaboration with others can unlock boundless potential.\n",

      "\"Sage, wolf's bane, hyacinth, nightshade... now call out the names of your beloved!\" I find myself turning into Tituba, leading my girls to sing the Barbados tune and dance frantically. In this madness, I have them possessed by the phantoms of Susannah, Mary, Betty...\\\\For me, the witchcraft in the play The Crucible had a double meaning, because while I was directing the drama I also seemed to be performing a ritual. Miller's original script and my imagination are the essential sorcery ingredients. I would shut my eyes tightly and my mind transported me from a warehouse packed with schoolwork into the virgin forest of Massachusetts, the last preserve of the Devil. \\\\Let the ritual begin!\\\\My magic is to channel my vision of the play into the bodies of my actors. Like a despot, I demanded every movement of the limb, turn of the head, flicker of the eyes to be presented as I wished; each tremor of the voice, each ringing of laughter, each burst of screaming to be exactly as I have designed. \\\\Something unexpected happened. It was our first mock performance. I watched tensely as on stage, the story starting to unfold. Each actor released his energy to his fullest extent, as we had practiced a hundred times. Paris weeping by Betty's bedside, Hale searching for signs of devil, Putnam refuting Rebecca... Yet, I felt something was wrong. Then Abigail came on stage and started to defend herself against Hale's suspicions, during which my vague feeling evaporated into clear understanding. The actress was not really following my instructions! She wasn't yelling at the top of her lungs, and her features were not as distorted as during our previous practices. Everything about her performance was more subdued, and yet her toxic love had become more disturbing than ever. It turns her into a serpent that bites rather than merely roars.\\\\\"Come with me, Proctor!\" \\\\Her begging is soaked in hot tears and her grief cuts into the deep heart's core. The heightened emotions and magnified motions I had demanded had covered up many subtle elements and emotions that could capture the audience, and now, acting on her free will, the actress allowed those details to surface. Instantly, I began to define that vague discomfort - it had been because of the play's unnaturalness. As the curtain lifted that evening, all I saw was a group of 17 year-old students straining themselves to act like 30-year-old puritans long demised. \\\\After the performance, my thoughts drifted from the play to the people I observed - a street musician playing guitar infatuated with his art, a boss of a late-night in chatting loudly with his customers, a stout lady bargaining with a vendor over a pair of socks - and it suddenly occurred to me that each individual has his or her own expression, idiosyncrasy, and drama. By compelling my actors to imitate my version of the characters, I was ignoring such elements. Thus, the life of the drama was being choked out, becoming a mere puppet show. Drama is about the unknown; it offers a chance for actors to explore and connect their personal dramas and the drama we are performing. \\\\Another ritual has begun. This time, I no longer lead, but witness. Eventually, the spell works and the puppets resume their energies. Milly speaks her bolder dash in her normal emotionless voice, creating a phantom-like effect; Jasmine adds a tinge of sweetness to Susannah and John Proctor moves in a rather awkward way so typical of Frank... Reality and imagination merge in an enchanting way as the rich souls of characters and actors mingle together. As I watch this transition, a fire is kindled inside me - a deep appreciation of the perspective and free will of each individual and a passion to learn more about people's inner worlds.\n",

      "I sped through the hallway with the quickness of an Olympic speed walker as I heard the shrill bell signaling the beginning of class. I approached the coral door to my calculus class, panicked about the impending exam. When I opened the door, I saw the words \"Puzzle Fun Time\" in bright blue. Nerves buzzing, I quietly slipped into my seat and stared at the intimidating test before me. I thought of \"Puzzle Fun Time\" as I glanced at the problems on the test. As the timer ticked away, my nerves were suddenly quelled and my mind focused on integrals and derivatives. My perception of the test as a mere puzzle instantly palliated my anxiety, and I applied the tools that I learned in class to creatively solve each puzzle. I was lost in my own euphoria as I solved each puzzle and returned to reality when the timer shrieked, signaling the end of Puzzle Fun Time.\\\\As I scrambled out of the car and sprinted up the driveway with my cumbersome load of books, I felt the same anxiety as I felt preceding my calculus exam. My hand grasped the rusted handle, and I opened the unlocked door. As I deliriously entered the house, I was greeted with the simple words, \"You're late\".\\\\I hastily set my books down and positioned my hands above the glistening keys. Although I was familiar with the weathered mahogany piano I had played once a week for eleven years, my fingers quaked and stiffened as they robotically translated the complicated black patterns in my books into sound. When I struck an incorrect note, I winced as I heard the scratch of Ms. Bao's pen as she marked another measure of music for me to practice. Her rebuke of my lack of skill was interrupted by the squeak of the door hinge as her next victim entered.\\\\After a particularly lamentable lesson, I refused to continue to dispassionately pound the wooden keys and butcher the composer's beautiful melodies.  I felt liberated when my mother allowed my resignation from piano; however, my freedom was only ephemeral. \\\\I sat on the mahogany bench next to Ms. Bao as she explained the basic concepts of composing music. The house was filled with warm tones as I experimented with the eighty eight keys, crafting a simple piece from different chords and melodies. As she praised my sense for composing, constructively critiquing my product and offering sound advice to improve the outcome of the patterns that I sketched, I realized that my piano lessons became my Puzzle Fun Time. Listening intently to Ms. Bao, a smile formed on my face as I felt the freedom to create. Composing let me create and solve puzzles rather than just perform another composer's puzzle. \\\\Through this change in perspective, I discovered that my passion for math and music relate through the simple concepts of solving and creating. Although math tests and composing are dissimilar, I applied the same logic of looking at the problems as a puzzle to both situations to develop solutions. I aspire to continue to pursue Puzzle Fun Time at a more advanced level beyond my individual world, by using the logical tool of mathematics to solve greater interdisciplinary problems with the freedom of creativity that I learned from piano.\n",

      "Astronomy has always captivated my imagination. As a child, I loved going outdoors on a clear night to gaze up at the stars, and on some nights I would spy a shooting star and wished that I could grow taller. In elementary school, my mother would read \"The Solar System for Kids\" to me every night, and eventually I memorized each planet's average distance from the sun, its circumference, and number of its moons. Soon, I began to view school as a way to advance my own understanding of anything space-related. Physics was a revelation to me, for I was able to incorporate math into the observational astronomy that I so enjoyed. I started making connections between the two, and I realized that I could maybe bring these ideas together to begin creating my own explanations of the universe. Perhaps it was the limitless nature of the universe that appealed to my equally-limitless curiosity.\\\\As my intellectual interests began to mature, I sought to delve further into such topics as cosmology and astrophysics. It wasn't enough for me to wonder what lay beyond, or whether intelligent life existed beyond our own world. I wanted to know how the universe fundamentally worked, from the tiniest subatomic particle all the way up to the largest galaxy filament. I read about impossibly complicated subjects like string theory and delved into equally fascinating people like Michio Kaku and Stephen Hawking. Through the Discovery Channel, I got to experience black holes with Hawking's Into the Universe. Recently, I was spellbound when I learned of a possible alien mega-structure around the star KIC 8462852, sparking my curiosity about the endless possibilities that it might entail: Could it really be extraterrestrial in origin? Is this proof that we are not alone? Perhaps intelligent beings created a \"Dyson sphere\" to harness the energy of a star! Or were there more natural phenomena at work here? These questions prompt me to once again contemplate the breadth of the universe.\\\\My dream is to conduct research on cosmological fields that would prompt advancements into modeling the continual change of the universe. I have often thought about detecting gravitational waves or discovering the graviton, the particle that supposedly mediates the force due to gravity. With this in mind, I plan to jump into research immediately as an undergraduate, and continue by pursuing a Ph.D, becoming a professor, and having similarly inspired students aid in my research. Looking to the future, space expeditions will become more and more common. In addition to getting a team onto Mars, I desire to collaborate with other astronomers and physicists to transport man-made objects into deep space. Today's technology allows astronomers to peer into the cosmic past through radio telescopes and has the potential to unlock the secrets of dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95% of the universe; ordinary matter makes up the 5% of the known universe. I want to explore that 95%. Scientists have analogized the universe to soup, a cookie, and even tiny little strings. I tend to think on a macroscale: Could the universe be shaped like a doughnut? How can I prove it? Proof is what matters to me. With proof, an explanation is complete and another mystery is solved.\\\\The universe is a vast place, perhaps even limitless. While others may be dwarfed by the vastness of it all and choose to simply ignore the splendor and sublimity of the stars, I keep looking outward. With every bit of knowledge I acquire, I bring my mind closer to those places where my physical body may never go.\n",

The paradox that has been most prevalent in my life has been my parents' relationship and its enduring nature. \\\\At its basic level, my parents' relationship is a beautiful love story. My father was born in Tehran, Iran and was raised as a devout Muslim. Attending Islamic schools, he enrolled in the Iranian military to fight a religious war against Iraq during the 1980's. In contrast, my mother was born in a very impoverished community in East Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants. Raised with Catholic teachings, she once entertained the thought of becoming a nun in order to fulfill her religious duties. \\\\Indeed, my parents grew up in entirely different cultures, but as the old adage goes, opposites attract. Thankfully for me, the environment my parents cultivated has instilled within me a holistic, rich, and vibrant perspective. Specifically, my family's background has enhanced my cultural awareness and ability to accept others. My upbringing has not always been easy; my Iranian side of the family are devout Muslims and have very stringent standards for female behavior. Women are forbidden to dance, but dance is my passion. Women are not encouraged to pursue education, but I thrive in the academic sphere. Women are obedient, but I had the iron-clad will of my fierce Mexican mother. Women are not supposed to lead, but I shined in my role as a leader, winning president for ASB, junior, and sophomore class.\\\\That said, the tug-of-war within my identity had its fair share of challenges, challenges that I eventually overcame with a better and stronger sense of identity.  And although there have been these challenges, my cultural background is incredibly vibrant: I've celebrated Persian New Year and Cinco de Mayo, I've eaten Koobideh and tamales, and I've sipped on Chai and Horchata. Apart from this gastronomical adventure, I've developed a significant cultural awareness that has fostered my thirst to learn about different cultures and people. \\\\Such awareness was amplified when I was invited to join the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHHS), which has allowed me to gain valuable insight into different cultures and experiences. The NSHHS hosts global conferences. By attending these conferences, I've interacted with people from various continents. Through such interactions, I have learned compassion and how to work collaboratively with others. Because I'm interested in pursuing a career in government and politics, these conferences have furthered my desire to understand the inner-workings of government. I've met and conversed with eminent figures such as Al Gore and Condoleezza Rice, and have also had the privilege of attending both of President Obama's inaugurations. From these conferences, I've gained a deep knowledge of how governmental systems operate. More importantly, I gained a desire to study political science and focus on international affairs. \\\\I am drawn to the study of political science because public policy and government shape society. Whether it be the rate of taxes or international affairs, politics is rooted in and impactful to almost every aspect of life. Even when I volunteered to canvass for an incumbent campaigning for the Water Board District, I felt as though I was making an impact, albeit a small one.  I want to play an active role in forming public policy and in shaping society; I hope to bring passionate, logic-based ideas to the forefront of global politics. Furthermore, immersing myself in political science would give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of government and policy on both national and international levels. \\\\My desire to pursue political science taught me that while my Iranian-Mexican background has brought many trials, it has ultimately taught me important life lessons. It has challenged my beliefs and self-identity and instilled in me a fire. This fire drives me to learn, to explore, to be more than an Iranian-Mexican. It is a fire that will light the pathway for further intellectual growth and world discovery as an advocate and scholar within the realm of political science.  It is this fire that will inspire me to become a true agent of change.\n"
