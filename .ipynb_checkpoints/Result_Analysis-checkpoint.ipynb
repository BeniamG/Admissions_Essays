      "The environment that one grows up in has a huge influence on their personality, whether they realize it or not. Being brought up in Singapore all my life has definitely had an effect on my dreams and aspirations. The most unique thing about the country of Singapore is how effectively it blends the Western and Asian culture to create its own unique identity.\\This mix of Western and Asian cultures has acquainted me with the best parts of both cultures.  Singapore being such an urbanized and developed country has made me more open to new opinions and ideas, and increased my international mindedness. However, being an inherently Asian country, I also learnt invaluable Asian values such as a degree of conservativeness, respect for others and the importance of family.  This culture blending has also allowed me to become more flexible in international environments, without losing my own cultural identity, and has in fact influenced my ambitions.\\The multiracial community in Singapore has also had a major influence on my outlook towards different people. As an Indian, Singapore's thriving Indian society is very important to me. Not only are we able to celebrate most of our major holidays as a community, but we also receive holidays for the most of the major ones like Diwali. This really holds a lot of significance for us especially since our indigenous festivals like Diwali and Holi are so widely recognized and celebrated. But one of the most special parts of living in Singapore is that we also get to celebrate festivals from other cultures. Consequently, despite being an Indian, I know exactly how and why Chinese people celebrate Chinese New Year and the significance of Hari Raya to the Malay. I am even considerably fluent in three languages - English, Hindi and French. This tolerant outlook that I have developed without compromising my own roots is another feature of my world that has prepared me to become a global citizen.\\The values that my family and community have taught me have also been very important in shaping my identity. Being an Indian away from home has, on the contrary, better connected me to my Indian roots. I have learnt a lot more about the Indian culture and way of life from my parents than I ever could have from living in India. Despite currently not learning Hindi, my mother tongue, in school, I speak the language fluently at home. All of these elements have made me aware of my roots and allowed me to become more internationally aware.\\The main implication of my upbringing has been the opportunity to be exposed to everything. Being able to combine humility with confidence and community with independence are things that I find the most unique about my world. Being in such a blended culture is what has allowed me to develop different aspects of my personality\\Living in a country as internationally linked as Singapore has also given me the opportunity to travel to a multitude of countries, having been lucky enough to explore several countries from Asia and Europe to countries in the Far East like Australia and New Zealand. I have even lived in and experienced the culture of Tanzania in east Africa, which is admittedly very different from the community in Singapore. Having experienced the atmosphere and environment of these various countries has made me more internationally aware and allowed me to grow as a more tolerant and open minded person.\n",

      "A classic Chinese Malaysian girl speaks Malay, at least a couple of Chinese dialects, and a mere three to four phrases of English; she attends a local school and has a perfectly refined bobbed haircut. I, on the other hand, am the polar opposite: I have grown up speaking English, have always attended an international school, and, on top of that, have long, curly, and uncontrollable hair. Because both of my parents had attended international schools in their youth and later studied in English-speaking countries, I was not born into a typical Asian family.\\I am ethnically Chinese but nationally Malaysian and was born on the tropical island of Penang. Penang is home for many expatriates as well as ethnically diverse natives, so many different cultures, religions, and languages have always surrounded me. Having attended international schools throughout my life, I interact with people from all around the globe, who expand my range of exposure to the world's cultures immensely, on a daily basis. My family still primarily upholds Chinese cultural traditions and values; but I am also heavily involved in other cultural practices, such as that of Koreans, Germans, and Americans. My neighbors are from South Carolina, and my best friend is half Filipino, half Malaysian, and was born in Canada. A weekly trip to the market involves hearing a blonde Englishmen butcher the Malay language to the shop-owners, and a visit to the mall entails seeing Japanese girls with dyed hair dressed in the latest American trends. My world is bizarre to most Malaysians. It is the greatest understatement to call it chaotic or quirky, but I love it. \\I am in my natural element when surrounded by people who differ from me. My daily experiences with many starkly different people have made me extremely passionate about creating worldwide equality, cooperation, and voice. I greatly value education of worldly issues and peoples, and exposure to their beliefs and practices has nurtured in me a love for learning about their unique countries and cultures. I have had an abundance of first-hand experience with cultural, racial, and religious interaction, and even sometimes conflict, which has taught me the importance of understanding individual differences. I want to rid the world of discrimination of and close-mindedness to anyone who does not fit into the \"norm\" and replace it with acceptance of open expressions of ideas and individuality. \\My world has made me hungry for the rest of the world. Many different cultures and peoples have permanently impacted me, and I could not imagine my life anywhere else but in an international environment. I plan to continue my discovery of the world community as well as contribute to my new university community through my experiences, knowledge, and passions for a globally united future. I strive to travel and explore, to reach outside of my comfort zone, because I know that there is much more to life than what I can see on my tiny island. I strive for the world.\n",

      "I consider myself a member of the second generation liberal mixed children's community, an extension of the 'Third culture kids' community. Whether Caucasian and Black, Asian and African or Latin American and Native Australian; we are the result of our parents' open mindedness to idea of the human race being but one entity and that our relationships, both plutonic and romantic, should be based on two people's compatibility and shared world views rather than ethnicity or social class. Being exposed to diversity and a multitude of cultures from an early age has allowed this community to grow and flourish producing well-rounded individuals with, I believe, realistic yet often idealistic notions of how the world works and how we as a global race should live to better life for all. The ideas of environmental sustainability, cultural diversity and an achievable global peace that many tertiary education institutions claim to hold at their core were the ideas started by our grandparents and passed two generations down. In short, we are the third generation hippie children. For me, however, I do not see my place in this community as the end goal. It is not enough to simply possess the knowledge and ideas necessary to create a better world, they must be applied. I take my privilege of having been exposed to a wider scope of the world than most very seriously and therefore I dedicate my life to share my ideas of a harmonious global society with the world. I plan to achieve this through my writing. Since I was young I have enjoyed stories and story-telling, but it was not until high school that I discovered writing could serve a greater purpose than simply sharing stories and experiences. Writing and other forms or expression, like my poetry, have become tools for me to share the views on the world I am fortunate to have developed. In my aspiration to make this world a better place I have found that the only way I can do that is through rhetoric. When people are presented with an idea which is well written and well argued they tend to listen to it, rather than just hear what you are saying. Throughout my life people have dismissed my opinions as controversy for the sake of controversy, however I have rarely share my vision with anyone simply to get a reaction. If I choose to discuss an issue with someone it will always be because I have strong convictions about that issue and I firmly believe that my input could enlighten others and benefit their lives. Yet, as a third culture kid, I am never too narcissistic to dismiss other people's opinions because of my own strong willed mindset. Rather, I love to listen to opposing views on things such as religion and LGBT rights because I wish to understand how and why others think differently than me. This is the only way for me to continue my worldly development, and continue to learn and grow as a member of our global community. I believe my exposure to varying aspects of the world and passion for idea sharing through rhetoric will eventually lead me to produce something worthwhile, which will ultimately be beneficial to many people worldwide.\n",

I continue to speak Turkish at home and have visited my Turkish friends and family every summer since moving. The impact of Turkish culture on my outlook has only grown with the passage of time. The culture I experienced in Turkey is defined by opposites, and Istanbul is the epicenter of contrast. Looking across the Bosphorus from my grandparents' house in Kanlica, I see both mosques and skyscrapers. Walking in the streets of Levent, I see wealthy businessmen walk past homeless mothers with their children. Turkey's mixture of tradition and modernity exposes me to the fascinating nature of cultures outside of the United States. It inspires me to learn about the people and cultures of the world, and to seek opportunities all over the globe. Furthermore, the disparity between the rich and the poor in Istanbul shows me the suffering that exists in the world, and has sparked my interest in human rights. \\\\My second home is Palo Alto, California, where I lived for eight years after leaving Turkey. In Turkey, I was only exposed to one complex culture. When I moved to California and began attending elementary school, I was suddenly surrounded by people of all nationalities and cultures. I developed friendships with people from countries such as Japan, Israel, Iran, and Nigeria. When I went to my friends' houses, I ate their food, heard their languages, and witnessed their traditions. The diverse environment of Palo Alto showed me the ideas and culture of people from countless backgrounds. But perhaps more importantly, it showed me the ways different cultures and nationalities can interact and mix in a positive way. These similarities and differences in perspectives fostered my interest in international relations. \\At the age of thirteen I moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where I have lived for the past four years. \\\\After attending large public schools in California, I was faced with a new kind of community in Birmingham: a small private school. When I started at the Altamont School, I transitioned from having twenty-five people in each of my classes to having forty people in my entire grade. It was difficult to adjust to this new environment, but I was able to adapt and form close relationships with my peers. My classes and teachers at Altamont inspired me to expand my knowledge outside of school. After taking classes like Europe and the Modern World, I began delving into topics such as international politics and philosophy at home. My time at Altamont provided me with a thirst for knowledge that will persist throughout my entire life.\\\\My life so far, which has developed in three equally important phases and locations, has shaped my ideas about the world, and the ways in which I seek to change it. Specifically, I am motivated to reduce global disparities in ways that respect different cultures and outlooks.\n",

      "My world is a movement. My dream is a vision. As an Indigenous youth delegate, I have witnessed both the prejudice from the dais and the relentless will of the human spirit. When I was eight, my school was targeted by terrorists through racially motivated hate crimes, threatening to leave us smoldering like \"burnt beans and tortillas\" in an attempt to spread fear and shut down our school. At fifteen, my school leaders were asked to prove their citizenship in a county school board hearing to renew our charter. I, consequently, along with my school leaders, successfully petitioned the California State Board of Education for the renewal of our charter. My testimony before the Board highlighted our right as a community to have our own school. This experience strengthened my voice from that of a timid child into one of an emissary, a leader, and a spokesperson. In my mother tongue, I am tlayecana: a guide. Anahuacalmecac, my culturally-based school, prepared me to become a culturally grounded community-based youth delegate. Our movement to defend our school is part of a global movement of Indigenous Peoples - a movement of survivance, continuity, and rebirth.\\My reality is ancient yet ephemeral, cosmopolitan yet provincial, personal yet global. As an International Baccalaureate World School student, I understand \"people, with their differences can also be right.\" With these teachings in my heart, I have been charged with leading dozens of cultural exchanges. Beyond my school, I am concerned with the state of Indigenous Peoples globally and the impact of climate change on our Mother Earth. Last academic year, I was selected by the founder of the U.S. Forest Service's Generation Green Consortium as a keynote speaker at the National Environmental Justice Conference in Washington D.C. I addressed current environmental concerns as an urban Indigenous youth and the lack of access to forests, mountains, or rivers by youth like me. My speech was important to secure an increase in funding for the Generation Green inner-city youth focused programming I have been a part of. In July 2015, I co-led a delegation to the first ever White House Tribal Youth Gathering where I engaged in meetings with heads of state, tribal leaders, and other Indigenous youth. I have also taken my advocacy on global issues to a college youth conference held at Los Angeles Mission College where I co-led a workshop through my native maternal language, Nahuatl. I then participated in an international United Nations preparatory conference on the issues impacting Indigenous Peoples, where I led the opening ceremony. My path through all of these experiences informs my vision of the unification of Indigenous Peoples globally and the well being of our Mother Earth. I have become an emissary for my generation - I stand for Mother Earth and all our animal relations, for my people, and our future. I am a conservationist at heart and a warrior in spirit. I am advancing a global movement envisioning a new destiny.\n",

      "When I first immigrated to America, my speech and understanding of English were limited, and it was very obvious. Because of my looks, my classmates, would question, \"Are you Chinese?\" The answer is simple, yet complicated. When I mention I am an immigrant, people commonly assume that I emigrated from China, and that I must speak Mandarin. Although there are some truths to this, there is more depth to my answer than a simple 'yes' or 'no.'\\\\I am ethnically Chinese, however I grew up in the southeast Asian country Myanmar. My great-grandparents migrated from China to Myanmar as merchants, like many other families. Chinese and Burmese cultures entwine to give me the pleasure of growing up with the best of both worlds. As a child I attended a Burmese public school and was taught Burmese customs and the history of the country. At home and in my community, elders would speak to me in a mix of standard Mandarin, a Chinese Fujianese dialect, and conversational Burmese. I have never differentiated myself exclusively as Chinese or Burmese, as I am both.\\ \\Moving to America has broadened my views even more. I used to joke with my cousins that we are \"ABC,\" as we are Americans, Burmese, and Chinese. As a student, I learn about the importance of individualism, innovation, and voicing my own unique perception. At home, sinocentric ideas of respect for elders and traditions are applied on daily basis. The American idea of freedom of speech and embracing one's own views inspired me to open up myself to debates and to challenge different ideas. A child who once had trouble voicing disagreement to her mother about why she preferred a different color shirt has transformed into a girl who can openly state her views on controversial topics, such as religious conflicts and gender roles, and stand by her own values.\\ \\Cultures of my background often have contrasting beliefs. Chinese-Burmese culture emphasizes upholding traditions and filial piety while American culture promotes innovation and individuality. With these differences in mind, I live by adapting to the combinations of cultures. I embrace and actively inquire about my background and heritages so that I know the history behind my origin. At the same time, I make sure to speak up for what I believe in and look past some antagonistic 'traditional views' for better ways to live by. My values accommodated each culture to take in a little bit of all, and I have learned to embrace the concoction of different traditions that has shaped me into who I am. As I continue to grow as a person, I see the world in blends of colors and different perspectives, and understand that there's more to life than black and white, just like how I am an assimilation of cultures.\n",

      "I always lived in the area of Paris or its near proximity. I was born in Neuilly Sur Seine, a very charming town west of Paris, a place characterized by its tranquility and enjoying many avenues and streets adorned with beautiful large trees. I moved then after three years to Levallois a town also just outside Paris and juxtaposing Neuilly. After that, we moved to the center of Paris and stayed since then in the same area. I particularly appreciate living in Paris and enjoy daily the magnificence of its public monuments and parks such as the Arc de Triomphe famed plaza, the wide plaza of the Concorde leading to the left bank through the national assembly and into the Latin district, home of most of Paris' student population.\\ My family is multicultural since my father is of Portuguese origin and my mother French.  My family is relatively small on the French side but quite large when it comes to the Portuguese side. We regularly visit Portugal every summer to get together with my extended family.  Since I know I am of mixed origins, it drives me constantly into a keen interest in discovering other cultures and customs and travel as much as I can with my parents. I follow Portuguese classes after school because I find it important to keep in touch with my roots. \\I greatly appreciate living in France since it is traditionally a country that readily welcomes immigrants coming from a variety of origins. The cultural fabric of the population has changed over the years with many new immigrants coming or being descendants of France's former colonies such as Africa or the countries of the Maghreb. This has posed a challenge for the government to assimilate them but the country has always advocated for its traditional and singular secularism and respect of the laws of the republic, a system that has always been very inclusive and that hold sway to the basic traditions and laws of French society. As a student of Portuguese origin, I have always found myself at ease with my classmates at with my school's environment.  \\Because I am of diverse origins and live among a multicultural population in today's France, I have learned to think about and respect other people's traditions and customs. I strongly believe that the challenge posed by the multicultural environment in France today can be address by inclusion and efforts to better respect other populations instead of trying to shun them socially or economically from society. Secularism is a great tradition provided we bring about accommodation for the ancestral customs of our peers.\n",

      "My world has not allowed me to shape my dreams and aspirations; my world has created a safe platform for me to stand on whilst I reach for my dreams.  \\\\Family has always been central in my life. Both my nuclear and extended family have been vital in my upbringing, being my support system and role models. Growing up in London whilst being fully Norwegian, I spent my childhood living in a small Norwegian bubble within an international city, a mini diaspora if you will. Having to manifest important aspects of Norwegian culture, speaking Norwegian and celebrating national holidays, my family became even closer. After moving to Norway, we still lived in our mini diaspora, celebrating Norwegian culture, however differently to native Norwegians, as in England, the original traditions had transformed. As many Third Culture Kids experience, as a teenager growing up in Norway, I did not feel a sense of belonging to either Norway or England. Having grown up in separate countries and without feeling tied to one culture has made me realise the importance of family, the one you are born with and the one you create on your own. \\\\Growing up in a multi-cultural environment, I was always surrounded by people from different corners of the world, speaking their own language and celebrating their own culture. This urban community created an atmosphere where everyone belonged, simply because everyone was unique. After moving to Norway, I was in a contrary predicament, finding myself in a society crafting homogenous young adults. I felt stifled, and the itch to be in a more challenging environment was growing.    \\\\Currently I attend Atlantic College, a United World School. Today, school is the community I contribute to and live in, it is the family that supports and surrounds me. With students from over 80 countries, and from every socioeconomic background imaginable, we create a resource, rarely found outside the UN, where we are able to discuss and problem solve using a global perspective. There are no boundaries to what we are able to achieve as together we represent the modern world, global citizens fighting for a better future. This on-going experience has made me realise how important languages are in the global world, fundamental the foundation of culture and global understanding. \\\\My world is ever changing, always evolving as I grow and as the world around me transforms. My world is the people I love, the things I love doing, and the challenges I overcome. My world is wherever my next adventure takes me.\n",

      "The international community that makes Singapore such a unique country is very much like a miniature version of the entire global community. People from a vast range of different countries live in coexistence in this small island country, making it one of the culturally richest nations of the world. \\\\What often occurs as a result of so many different groups of people living together is a dynamic exchange of ideas and traditions. The most prominent evidence of this is the religious composition of Singapore. Here in Singapore, Christian, Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist festivals are recognized as national holidays. None of these religions are enforced on anyone, but most residents of Singapore happily acknowledge each other's religious beliefs and respect the ideologies they support. To put this in context, I remember walking down a road one day, only to come across a street named Temple Street. At the end of this street, I noticed, was an old Hindu temple. Surprisingly, right behind this street was Mosque Street, down which a mosque stood facing the Hindu temple a mere street away. What was even more peculiar was the fact that these structures were standing right in the middle of Chinatown, a predominantly Buddhist-influenced area of the city.\\\\This isn't to say that Singapore is completely free of social stigma - inevitably, there are more controversial issues that not everyone can come to a consensus on, and which are more sensitive to certain groups of people. Furthermore, Singapore is generally a relatively conservative country, with its roots mainly grounded in more Asian countries than Western ones. On the whole, however, living in this country taught me more about celebrating and accepting differences than any respectable teacher could possibly have done. \\\\In today's society, ideological differences culminate to brutal conflicts, and obstinate advocates of a belief attempt to justify their acts of violence with the very principle that led to their unreasonable and unethical conduct. From living somewhere where clashes between contrasting beliefs are not the primary cause of disputes, I have cultivated a humble dream to propagate the notion that differences should be celebrated rather than criticized. In many other places on the planet where there is a clear distinction between a major and minor ethnic or religious group, I would like to encourage the initiative of viewing something out of the ordinary as 'different', rather than 'wrong'.\n",

      "Answering the question of where I come from, blends the places I have lived in, determines my ethnicity and the source of my unique accent. The seemingly simple question is a complex life story for me as an international student. I believe that the world I come from determines the kind of individual I will be to the world.\\\\Salzburg the elite town, in the north of Austria, was my first home.  Growing up in this classical town, enveloped by nature, the environment became an important aspect in my life.  Cycling everywhere became a norm in this environmentally conscious place.  Walking around I discovered old 15th century buildings and museums packed with stories from the past. The beauty of growing up in a place filled with culture and history has made me adhere to traditions and enjoy the cultural aspects. This sense of tradition and heritage has given me a sense of belonging. The \"safe world\" Salzburg portrays, has had an impact on how I view society.  I approach the world with optimism and positivity. I have lost my heart to this town and my loyal childhood friends. I appreciate how Salzburg keeps me grounded and offers a place I can identify myself with. \\\\A contrast to Salzburg is the cosmopolitan city of Cape Town, also known as the mother city. It lives up to its name as it has further nurtured me and given me the chance to grow as a person and has opened my eyes to a wider worldview.  Faced with all races, ethnicities, and beliefs, I have learned about tolerance.  George Eliot quoted, \"The responsibility of tolerance lies within those who have the wider vision.\" Due to Cape Town's diversity, I have come to see more of the world and therefore have also become more open- minded . Experiencing the big city existence, and the harsh contrast between poverty and wealth, has heightened the importance of family to me. In Cape Town, things are more uncertain, similar to other big cities. The feeling of a compact \"safe world\" is not present. Therefore holding together as a family has become an intense and valuable part of my life.  \\\\Not one place or aspect has changed me the most. The diversity of ingredients make it interesting, and continue to shape me into a global citizen. My background has influenced my future decisions and aspirations. I want to be a part of the leaders of tomorrow, creating my own business ideas and having a voice in world politics while still looking out at the World that continues to be my playground.\n",

      "My life has been filled with life changing events, these events have all carved and shaped who I have become. I have become a caring, determined, and hard working  person. The different events I have gone through are: family death, gang influence, drug influence, and being told I was not smart enough to be in rigorous classes.  Although these challenges were imposed on me, I have still been able to succeed and will continue to succeed in the future.\\\\My Junior year was plagued with close family losses. I quickly had to learn how to control my sorrow because I still wanted to excel in school, sports, clubs, and my job.  Honestly, this is the hardest things I have ever gone through because all these people were so close to me. My dear Grandmother passed away in June 2014, then shortly after my nephew passed. My aunt died of cancer in January, 2015, and shortly after, my godfather passed away the day of my birthday February, 2015. Through these sad times I became closer with my family and learned to live in the moment because we never know when our time is up. \\\\Growing up, I lived in the Chicago Southside.  A place that is riddled with drugs and gangs. Although I was surrounded by negative influences in my childhood, my parents always made sure to keep me away from those evils that plague society.  My mother and father could not protect me from seeing everything and I still remember the two times I witnessed a drive-by shooting at my park.  This left a big impression on me that I did not want to end up like those kids so with the help of my mom and dad I was able to succeed in school. Seeing that we were excelling in school my parents were inspired and worked very hard to move to a better neighborhood. We moved when I was 10 to a better neighborhood. It was a great decision to leave because now some of the kids I knew are either in gangs or in jail.  I get sad thinking about them, but then I remember that later in life I can help make sure that everyone goes on the right path. Peer pressure is very prominent in all schools and for me the availability of drugs promoted this pressure. Although it was very tough, I was able to stay on the right track and I did not fall under the influence of drugs to this day.\\\\When 8th grade hit, it was time to take the placement test at the local high school as well as a top high school in Chicago. I have never been great at Standardized Tests therefore, I scored poorly on both exams. I was declined from the top high school in Chicago and was recommended for really low level classes at the local school.  This really shocked me, but I did not let this stop me from excelling in school. I thought back to where I had come from and said to myself, \"you can do it!\".  With this attitude my parents called the school and asked for me to be put in all the honors classes. I knew that it was going to be hard, but with hard work I could achieve a lot in these classes.  I not only proved myself right that I was fit for the Honor level rigor, but also proved that a test does not determine intellect.  Throughout my time in high school I have made sure I am pushing myself and excelling in these hard classes. The best part is looking back at what this one test said and looking at where I stand now.\\\\Witnessing the hard work my dad does to keep our family together really pushes me to work rigorously in school. Also, by growing up with little and in a bad environment it really makes me appreciate all the chances and opportunities I have been given. I will push and make great use of the opportunities that I have. I know that these factors really helped in making the very kind hearted, determined, hard working, humble, and over achieving person I am today.  Challenges have always been in my way.  I never have the easy way to get what I want and I am grateful for this because it makes me work one million times harder to get where I want to go. I strive to attain higher education and to one day own my own company.\n",

      "At one point everyone has to go through hard times in their lives. I've faced so many obstacles, but I faced one that changed mine and my family's entire life. My dad is the only one in the house that works. He's been working hard to give us a better life. He wants to make sure that my little sisters and I get a good education. \\      The life I have now is thanks to my parents. They've raised me to be a good, determined, generous human being. They've taught me that life isn't always easy and to never give up. My dad still tells me how giving up isn't going to solve problems and that it won't help me in life. He always says that in order to become someone in this world I have to follow my dreams and fight for what I want. My dad is my motivator; I look up to him because he's a hard working person. Seeing how much he struggles motivates and encourages me to work harder so I can give back everything he has done for me.\\      I seriously thought we were a happy perfect family, that nothing bad would ever happen to us, but I was wrong. Three years ago my life completely changed, my family wasn't the same. One night my dad was coming home from work and before going home he stopped by my uncle's job. My uncle offered him one beer and he took it. On his way home he got pulled over by a cop; he was arrested and charged with a DUI. My dad called and he told us what happened. The next morning my grandpa and my uncle went to the Van Nuys Jail to get more information on my dad's case.\\      Later that week he was transferred to the L.A county jail. He was there for three months; he said that prison isn't a place where human beings should be. He wanted to get out of there, so without his lawyer's concern he signed some documents. The same day he signed the documents he was deported and sent to Tijuana, Mexico. When we heard the news I couldn't believe it. I felt that it was unfair because the judge didn't pay attention to my dad's case; the judge didn't take in consideration what we had to say and how this was going to affect our family. That night he was deported I cried myself to sleep. \\      As time passed by I was getting used to the fact of my dad not being around. I was so depressed. My mom was struggling; we barely had enough money for anything, she had to pay bills, sometimes she wouldn't have enough money to feed us. My mom is the strongest bravest women I know, I don't know what we would have done without her. My dad was still in Mexico and he found a place to live in, he got a job. It was hard not having him with us, we missed him so much. Holidays were the worst, holidays are meant to spent time with your loved ones and we didn't have that. I felt that my dad suffered the most during this time of our lives. He went through everything, he was all alone without any family, sometimes he didn't have enough money to eat, he was kidnapped and he also had money stolen from him several times.\\      Throughout these terrible years in my life I didn't imagine myself going to college. Since there wasn't enough money I wasn't sure if I was going to go. I kept telling myself that instead of applying to college I would be applying to fast food restaurants to help my mom. Slowly I started giving up on school, my grades were dropping. My mom noticed and she told my dad. My dad called me and he told me not to give up, to try my best because he wants to see me succeed. He said if I care for him to not give up. I changed because I want to make him proud and I want him to know I'm not a quitter. \\      My dad was able to cross the border after three years. We were happy and relieved because we knew all our worries were going to be solve. I would've never imagined myself applying to college. I was sure that instead of applying to college I would be applying for jobs. This life experience changed my life for the better because it made me into a stronger person and I'm okay it happened because if it didn't I would have not been the person I am right now.\n",

      "My teenage years were not of a typical teen because instead of socializing outside of school, I stayed home and cared for my five year old brother which developed the desire to care for others. Consequently, I have become responsible at home and in the classroom. \\Unfortunately, at the age of fourteen, my parents were in the process of divorcing. My mother, my brother and I, eventually moved to a new home leaving my dad behind. It took time to adjust to the new lifestyle, but I learned to accept it. As a teenager, I was required to balance my life with school and family. For example, I had to maintain my grades as best as I could in order to reach my long-term goal. It was difficult because my mother worked from eleven in the morning to eight at night and I was responsible enough to ensure that my brother was receiving a good amount of attention to meet his needs.Because of my experience, I want to become a Pediatrician as a future profession.\\Pediatrics is a branch of medicine that deals with the medical care of infants. Therefore, I have built the desire to be able to help other children become healthier.  I want to be able to give a positive influence in their lives. In order to reach my long-term goal I must prepare myself now. There are several steps I must follow that will lead me to the goal which I have established. This includes, receiving a High School Diploma, graduating from a four year college, passing the medical admission exam, graduating from medical school and to become a certified pediatrician of Pediatrics. \\As my teenage years go by I see myself growing into a young adult. Since a very young age I had to face challenges that I would soon overcome. I practically raised my brother while my mother was at work because I had no problem with it, instead I wanted to help in anyway I possibly could. Today I thank my brother because he is a significant figure in my life. He has made me a stronger person throughout my parents' divorce. I remember him being supportive by always finding a way to cheer me up. Although my brother was very small, he was aware of the situation and understood. We both knew that no matter what happens, we had to stick with each other and always watch out for each other. The important part, however is that we had that unconditional love for each other. Today I am proud of  still doing what I do best, which is caring for the ones I cherish. Through my experiences, I have learned that I could conquer any challenge that life may throw because I am mature and most likely to accept things the way they are. I'm also aware that I have developed many characteristics that has helped me shape my person I am today. I am independent, responsible, supportive and strong. As for my schooling, I plan to prepare myself now by getting more involved in my high school through participation in clubs that will benefit those in need, training to become a skillful leader and performing my best in my academics and community. As I do this to better myself, it will ultimately lead me into a four year college. I want to be able to be a role model for those who may be going through the same situation as I did and prove the many positive possibilities even with struggles that may occur. Furthermore, I truly believe it is the simple things that will help me reach my goal in life. \\\\In conclusion, this experience, though challenging, it has been the foundation in helping me discover the person I am today. I have grown to be a lovely, young adult who is open minded.  As a result, I have became a strong person emotionally and mentally. Though I have been through hard times, my life has changed me in a positive way. I plan to share my story with those in need and hope to influence their perspective in life. I've learned that the key to success is to be a positive influence. My experience has shaped my life which allowed me to develop the desire to care for others.\n",

      "Growing up as a foster youth and getting adopted has always been a challenge for me. I knew who my mother was and I wasn't disconnected from my family, but I never knew why I had to be a foster child. Information on why I was taken away from my mom was always kept a secret. As much as it affected me, I never tried letting it affect my school work. Getting an education had always been important to me. \\When I moved to with my aunt who is my guardian, I felt like I lost \\everything. I was never kept away from my mom. I would always see her every weekend. After I moved, things changed. The closest thing I had were only  phone calls. Life took a toll on me. My education went down the hill and I missed seeing my mom. It took months for me to get used to being a thousand miles away from my mom. When I finally got used to a new environment, I thought of some ways I could stay with my mom. I talked to my aunt and asked if it was alright if over the summer I could live with my mom, she approved it. When I moved with my mom, I realized I needed to focus on school. I knew life was beginning to change for me, living with my mom was a great start to change my life around. I started high school off as a confused freshman, afraid of not making any friends and being lonely. I didn't let my fears get the best of me, I walked around school introducing myself to my peers hoping I get a positive response, and I did. Although my social life freshman year was great, my grades weren't as great. I was too focused on making friends, Instead of making good grades. At that time, my grades didn't bother me so I continued worrying about the\\wrong thing.When summer came, I had summer school for failing two classes. I was upset because I had to cancel my summer plans and instead go to summer school. Then I realized, I should not be upset because it was my fault for having to take the two classes over. I went to summer school for four weeks, and I can say it was the toughest four weeks of my life. It was a challenge trying to fit a whole semester of learning into only four weeks. Although, it was hard trying to learn a Semesters worth of work in only two weeks for each class, I passed both classes with an \\A and a B After summer school, I learned I did not want to be in that same situation again so I will need to focus on my school work and work harder. Sophomore year, I was focused on two things and this time it was getting good grades and also making friends. I worked hard to pass each class. That way I would be putting myself in a right direction of not taking any class over. I did not fail any class sophomore year, but I was not happy with my work. I realized I needed to focus on one thing and that is my education and not friends. I knew I needed to make changes about myself, in order to do the right thing. Junior year came, I was more focused on my education and I did not want anyone or anything stopping me from learning all of the materials I need in order to graduate. Junior year was a bit hard because I had eight classes that I needed to pass. I did struggle from time to time and I did pass all of my eight classes, I thought I never would pass. I never believed in myself passing eight classes, and I did. I got honor roll for maintaining good grades and having a 3.67 GPA for the semester. I was so proud of what I accomplished and I wanted to continue working hard. It is now my senior year! This is not anytime for making friends or failing any classes. I have been making sure I am on top of my grades every day. I will not accept anything lower than a B. I want to get honor roll again, except I want to get honor roll for having a 4.0 GPA. I have never gotten straight A's or a 4.0 GPA, I am doing everything I can reach that goal.\n",

      "My father always told me, \"Don't follow in my footsteps, go further than I did.\" I was born to two Vietnamese parents. Both of them were immigrants were first generation. They both arrived to the United States empty-handed and were hoping for a chance to not only to help their families back home, but to make a new life for themselves. r Then I was born, February 6th, 1998 in Northridge Hospital Medical Center in the neighborhood of Reseda in the city of Los Angeles, California. My parents, with what little time they had available between jobs, spent all their time giving me all their love. Eventually, after some years of living like this, my mother decided that she and my father had to move. That they had to go find better jobs as to better support me in the future. Then we moved, we moved three times, over the course of several years, before finally settling down in the city of Lancaster. Along the way, my mother gave birth to my sister Merlyn. The birth of my sister only reinforced my mother's desire to find better jobs to help my sister and I in the future. After several years, my parents were able to find a job they could comfortably hold onto. There was always one thing that my parents made sure that my sister and I felt during our years of living. They made sure that we did not feel like low class citizens. In my young age, I never really thought about my family's economic situation. It was only recently did I ever really put two and two together. My parents worked themselves to the bone in order to not only feed my sister and I but to also make sure that we had everything we wanted. When I finally saw this, I understood why my parents would not buy me lunchables or new toys. It was not because they did not want to, it was because they could not afford it. The same phrase my father told me every year suddenly became much more real.  My father risked everything to make sure that his family was well fed and that his children grew up living a life that he could have never had. With this in mind, I made a decision. I decided that I would not follow in my father's footsteps. I would follow a different path, a path that held more oppurtutnities for me to lead a successful life. I would go to college, get a degree in mechanical engineering, get a job with a modest and honest company, and make my parents proud. I would help them with their financial insecurities and I would make it so that they could retire peacefully. I would make it so that even though my parents went through such hard times, they could look at their son and be proud. Be proud that he did not follow their footsteps and instead walked a different, much brighter path. I want to live out the dream my parents always had for me. I want to become a mechanical engineer, who works hard at his job in order to provide and care for his kids and be able to visit the parents without worry for financial restraints. In order for me to fulfill these wants, I put my father's morals into action. Since the beginning of Freshman year of Highschool, I would always center my plans around taking care of my sister. My parents work Monday through Saturday and they needed to have someone watch over my sister. So, I suggested to my parents that I would just watch my sister at home and they not have to worry about it. Even though there were plenty of events that I had wanted to go to, I would always decide to skip it and go home in order to watch over my sister and care for her if she needed it. Although I did focus some of my attention to caring my sister, I focused the rest of my attention to attending school and becoming the best student that I could try to be. I did this to not only prove to myself that I could be successful, but to also show my parents that I was ready to do what needed to be done in order to succeed in life. I want to become the son of whom my parents can talk about to strangers and family alike, with nothing but pride in their hearts and minds.\n",

      "Growing up as an African American child in a low-income neighborhood. I am supposed to fall in the normal statistics that say every other black child will not succeed. I grew up in South Central Los Angeles and in my neighborhood not everyone graduate from high school. Usually African American people in South Central are known as high school dropouts, have no aspirations, and work for minimum wage. Teenagers like myself will typically be the young mothers on government assistance. Regardless the obstacles thrown my way because of my background there is nothing I will not do to prove the people who doubted me and follow my dreams.\\\\From the age 2 to 8 I grew up in a household with just my mother and two older siblings. For 6 years I had no idea what a father figure was suppose to be, I questioned myself and my mother on why my dad was gone for so long. I didn't understand why were our conversations on the phone were limited or why he didn't come visit me so I blamed my self for his actions. I cried my eyes out with nothing in my heart to forgive him at the time. One day you can say my family life turned around for the better. My father came home from jail. I was a clueless eight year old that didn't know how to accept it. Days after his arrival my mother was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and I blamed my father. I blamed my father because during those 6 years he left our family, my mother experienced so much stress as a single parent, which inevitably took a toll on her health. In my opinion maybe if he was home that illness would have never crossed her path. When my mother told me about her diagnoses I was filled with emotions because I couldn't imagine life without her. Yes I forgave him but I will never forget the pain he caused my family. Once I came to the realization of the situation I knew that I had to become a backbone to other children like myself including my older sibling, they did not know how to handle the situation like I did. One parent in the state penitentiary and the other, praying that cancer won't over power her life.\\\\The strength I developed over those six years helped me become the person I am today. I wouldn't change anything that happened in the past. From the day my mother told my about her disease until that day forward I knew had to strive to become someone and beat the odds. Throughout high school I have maintained good grades such as A's because I know that it's the only way to successfully continue my education. Being a hopeless child around that time motivated me. And until this day my mom struggles with cancer but if she can raise three kids on her own for six years, her and I can over come anything. \\\\My focus in my everyday life has been school and I have come to realize education is the key to success. There was a time when I thought there was nothing that can solve my problems. By putting my faith in God, it helped conquer, achieve good grades and to stay focus. I plan on being the first person in my family to attend a university. I am who I am because of my experiences in life and overcoming those experiences sculpted me into wanting to become a nurse. I have a kind heart. I believe this career is very rewarding both mentally and emotionally. Through being a nurse I can make a difference in the lives of many people and bring hope to any situation they may have. I have took on volunteer work at convalescent homes and children hospitals to get the feeling of the career I want to take on in my life. My goal is to help the people around me have better days than I did. And to always remember there is hope in your darkest situation.\n",

      "I come from a large hispanic family that lives in Los Angeles. I have three brothers and one sister, and I also have two nieces and one nephew. I only live with my mom, younger brothers, and two nieces. I feel confused or overwhelmed when people ask me how many siblings I have, not because of how many there are but because I am not sure whether to say two or three brothers. Very recently, around the middle of junior year, my older brother passed away in a cruel way. He had two daughters, ages two and the other only six months old, they were left to live with me and my family. The event shocked my family and many close friends. We had to change almost every aspect of our lives. Exactly a year later, my father died from a cerebral collapse. It felt like a personal test of courage and strength, not only for me but for my entire family. It changed the way I saw my future plans, I thought of  my old dreams of going far away for college and focusing on my studies as selfish. I now see my future plans as a way to honor my brother and father's hopes for me and a way to inspire my younger brothers and nieces. Being a young hispanic girl  from Los Angeles no longer defined me, what defined me was my love for my family and my drive to make them proud. Over a year has passed since my brothers death and a couple months since my father's, but I now feel a passion to work hard and make my family proud.\\Receiving honor roll or principal's honor roll at least once every year I have been in high school is one of my proudest accomplishments. There have been times when I have had difficult moments in school and felt like giving up, but I see my awards as evidence that I overcame the difficulties and continued to work hard for the sake of my future and my family. I am reminded that I received my awards through hard work, determination, and by not giving up and staying up for many late nights on my own. They are more than just awards to me, they are reminders that I can accomplish anything even under large amounts of stress and self-doubt. My favorite part of getting the award was sharing with my parents that I received honor roll or principal's honor roll. I feel pride being able to see the smile on their faces and showing them that all my hard work and late nights studying paid off. Since they have always emphasized the importance of education, I become more motivated to witness moments like that in my life. I know that I can continue to push my limits and do even better each time because I have done it many times before. That is why I value my certificates so much, they're reminders of my hard work and struggles, not just my letter grades. \\I also have need to see the world far beyond my immediate environment. From the time I was a child, I have been a quiet and shy person that is too scared to take risks, staying within my personal boundaries and did what I was expected of me. But now I want to push my personal limits, and expand my boundaries. I have set a goal to myself to try new things and be open minded. Although I grew in a big city, I was not allowed to leave my house because of the dangerous streets and the strange people. My parents were very careful to shelter me and warn me about the outside world, but I realize that the world has changed since then and I want to become one of the people that changes it even more for the better. My goal is not to travel around the world, but to learn about it as much as can whether by seeing it myself or meeting new people and becoming a more well rounded person. Society is constantly evolving and I want to be part of the change for the better.\n",

      "Growing up as a child born in Mexico and coming to the United States at an early age made my childhood rough. Not knowing any English I was lost in school not knowing what to do causing me to hate school for the first year. After realizing I had a hard time learning, my parents decided to talk to me about it. One night my parents had a conversation with me explaining how important it is to get good grades in school and going to a university to obtain a bright future for myself. The words I will never forget that my dad said that day are, translated in English, \"In order to get something you want , you have to try\" A few months later I was obtaining good grades by trying and asking for help when I needed it. This not only taught me to try in school, but to become the best role model I can be for my brother and sister.\\Ever since that conversation I started to notice that I had the potential to become a good student in school and to be one of the top students in my classes. As the years passed I was getting A's and B's as my average grades making my parents and myself proud. Never will I forget the hug I received from my parents when I earned to be a part of Honor society in second grade. This was such a huge accomplishment for me that I was able to keep up the good grades. After getting into good routines to get good grades in school, getting good grades just became easy to achieve. However as the years went on and I had more responsibilities I found it harder to keep up the grades. It was my freshman year I learned that I had to put in the extra effort to stay afloat and pass my classes to have good reflections on my grades. \\The biggest difference that caused me to figure out my schedule involving sports, clubs, school along with homework and studying was when I asked for a job at Cardoso and Son's Dairy, where my father works,  located a few blocks away from where I live. This job was a blessing and a curse.  It was a curse because I had to try even harder to keep up my grades causing me to stress over the simplest of things at first. However I noticed the job was more of a blessing than a curse. From my work I learned and was able to set up schedules and routines more easily, making responsible decisions, setting up priorities, and was none the less but a huge step in being treated like a young adult. Everything was going great for me until my grandma's death that was on the same day I did my confirmation.\\Not knowing how to handle it I gave up on everything because my grandma was such a great influence and one of the people that made the biggest difference in my life that I cared for. It was so devastating to me that I ended up quitting my traveling soccer team because I had no motivation to do anything at the time. A few weeks passed since the incident and I received a progress report from the school, shocked by my grades, I knew I was going down the wrong path for my future. It was at that moment that I decided I had to improve my grades for my grandma because I knew she would want me to succeed in school. \\At the age of sixteen I was lucky enough to have my provisional license and a provisional license to drive tractors due to my expectations and duties at the dairy from where I work. Knowing I was able to go anywhere at anytime and having money to spend I wanted made me slack off in school. Going out literally everyday made my grades drop so much that my parents had to limit me going out with my friends and spending my money. At first i was furious because I thought it wasn't fair for them to do so because I worked hard for those things and I thought deserved to have time for the things I wanted to do for myself not taking in considerations my responsibilities and priorities. Looking back at it now I thank my parents for putting me back on track before it was too late.\n",

      "At the age of two my family decided to move to Mexico but it didn't work out, i left Mexico to start a new life with my family in the United States, it was obvious that i wasn't that different than other kids in school. I made so many friends and i was just happy i wasn't alone even though i was a little girl.\\\\In the world i come from there is different types of people, some are great some are just ordinary people. Such as my family, I have a great family. My family is always supporting me at everything. They notify me to let me know that to never give up to what i want to achieve. We have struggles, but my family still manages to go through the struggles. Me and my family been through so much, such as like me losing my uncle was really bad. It got in my way in school, and it was like i lost my best friend. It was the worst day of my life. He was the one that i would go to every time i had a problem in school. The one i can depend anything on. I was doing really bad in school because all i would think about was him, because i lost someone really special in my life. Then, i started thinking that he's still by my side at all times and i know he doesn't want me to make mistakes in school. Now it still impacts me but i still manage to go through it, what keeps me going more and more is me thinking about him and my uncle telling me i can do anything i want and to achieve my goals and be a different person, and mainly just be someone in life. I've learned a lesson after all of the things that happened because i messed up in school by thinking of my uncle so much but then i was getting more focused at school, i knew i was messing up. Also, even though you lose someone that is very important to you just try your best to focus on what is ahead of you because that person is looking down on you watching you achieve for dreams.\\\\MY short term goals are seeing myself in college getting my bachelors degree. Its going to take atleast 4 years, but i'm going to try my best at getting it. I just hope that nothing goes wrong and i'm not going to give up at all. My family depends on me now since i am the youngest. I'll achieve this goal in college by doing good in my classes and just focusing more in school. I'm not going to let anything get in my way. My long term goal in ten to twenty years is already becoming a doctor or surgeon and having a family, it's going to take time for me to be one of those things, but i'm willing to go after my dreams. My dreams have influenced me by many things. Such as my brother, he's been through so many surgeries since he was a little baby and he's still struggling now and his surgeon is trying his very best to help him through the rest of the surgeries he's having. That has gave me a feeling of blithe, because everytime he gets out of his surgery he's fine. That is why i want to be a surgeon i want to help save people's lives and make their family happy. Another thing is there is so many little kids out there that are really sick and some of them need immediate surgery, and that makes me sad because some kids can't get surgery and i would want to help them get even though if they have to pay for their surgery i can help them also. This motivates me by being a surgeon because i care about other people's lives because i know how it feels to lose a person, or a little child. All of this relates to my success in college because i'm going after my dreams, and i'm not going to stop till i get closer and closer. I'm just looking at what's ahead of me. \\\\In conclusion, i'm going to go after my dreams whether it takes time. I want my family to know they can depend on me at all times and know that their little girl can make them happy by being what she wants to be when she grows up. MY success is measured by the strength of my desire; the size of my dreams; and how i handle the disappointment along the way.\n",

      "Being the first to attend college in my hispanic family is one of the things that has lead me to keep going. With an older brother who decided to not attend college and both my parents dropping out of high school, I knew I had to make a change.\\Seeing my dad struggle day by day to get his family what they want has motivated me very much. Long days and nights of work would pay of when my brother went to college we all thought, but it wasn't that way. My brother graduated late from high school because he decided to slack off while being there. Throughout middle school years he was an honor roll student but hanging out with the wrong people affected him. At the age of 14, I had to watch him throw away his life which changed all of my family completely. His actions not only affected him but also me, I looked up greatly to my brother and as a kid, I always said that I wanted to be just like my brother. Seeing him struggle throughout high school and struggle afterwards trying to find a job just because he only had a high school diploma made me want to be better than that. He decided to not study and now seeing him struggle just the same as my dad makes want to give my family hope for a better life. \\My dad worked seven days a week and although we had everything we needed, we soon didn't have the most important thing, a father to be there and encourage us. It became harder and harder to talk to my dad, he got home tired and lacked to see we needed at least a day with him. Although I do greatly appreciate everything he does for us and everything he gives us, at least knowing he was present and cared about our future would've made it a little easier to keep going. I now realize he did and does care, but always wanted to make sure we had absolutely everything we need. My mom was a stay at home mom, like many other hispanic moms. She was the one we would vent to and have to give us advice or motivate us to keep going and I believe that's why we all have a stronger bond with my mom rather than with my dad. \\ Being my sister's role model has always been my goal. Although my family has been through a lot I want her to know that if she sets her mind to it she can achieve anything. Just like I looked up to my brother I want her to look up to me and know that I will always motivate her to do her absolute best and be there to encourage her.\\I am a Hispanic student with the same dream as many others, to attend college. I was terrified to think that I would have to live miles away from my family, or stay in debt.I realize that I don't have to leave thousands of miles away and there is always many ways of help to help pay off for college. Now I know exactly what I want to do. With a brother who didn't further his education into college and parents that came here from Mexico to give us a better life, I knew I had to take this opportunity and achieve my goal. Showing my little sister that school is very important has been one of my priorities. I believe that everything she sees being done is what'll she'll do and so that's why I try to give the best out of me. I have always took chances, risks, and opportunities that come my way. Going into the medical field has always seemed interesting to me.\\ Since I was little I loved helping people. I was always interested in the way medicine works and now taking medical classes has also helped me to realize that this what I want to succeed in. Furthering my education will help me in many ways and I do hope I will be able to help my parents as well as my siblings. I understand all my family's sacrifices and I want to show them that at the end everything is worth it, and giving up is not an option.\n",

      "This place was dark. I was sitting on the ground, with my legs crossed. It was silent. I heard nothing. I was perfectly calm. Everything was covered in darkness. I could feel the borders around me, it was a giant box. Suddenly, the four walls fell down, and the lid disappeared. It felt like I was free. I was then in a world of my own, and that box have stretched out endlessly. \\I started walking aimlessly. I did not know where I was going. I saw a shade of grey appeared at my feet. It rushed drastically in every direction. Soon, the color grey damped the pitch black. Along with the color grey came a very, very long road. It was made of small, round, white pebbles, carefully placed into these preformed shapes. I bashfully drew my first step on the road. I was afraid that the cacophonic sound of the pebbles would break the soothing silent. My bare feet touched the pebbles. I could feel the cool, smooth surface of the rocks, moving in motion. I closed my eyes tightly, preparing for that horrific rumbling sound I thought the pebbles would make, but it sounded like a canorous symphony with the music notes dancing away through the air. I started slowly walking along that road. Trees emerged from the ground, dead trees. Their lackluster, long branches were like monstrous fingers, and they were trying to grasp at me; at least I thought that they were. \\I continued on this indefinite path, and it felt like ages have passed. Everything felt boring. I was dragging myself on this road, sprawling desperately. Nothing has changed. The same scene kept on going, and I kept on walking. I thought to myself \"Is everything already predetermined?\" \"Is this my destiny?\" I would never accept such fate, but it seemed hopeless. I stopped, looked down, and I sat in that same exact position, with my legs crossed. I thought of what I could have changed, what could have been different. Little did I know, everything was morphing along with my thoughts. I opened my eyes, and I was met with awe. I was then inside a house, a blue, small house, and I saw me. I was happy. I was happy with my family. We were happy. What I wanted in life, what I wanted to change, it all happened. A warm, happy family, full of smiles and happiness. I found happiness.\\That was my utopia, where everything went my way. \"But is there such a thing as a perfect world?\" I asked myself. Only in a dream could there be a flawless world like this. Indeed, I was just dreaming. I closed my eyes, and I woke up. Back to reality, I went. I was disappointed. It felt like a part of me have just died. \\But then I closed my eyes, and I was back to that same place again. Everything of the outside world was blocked. The voices, sounds, images, scenes, everything was gone. I am back to the place where I have found utmost happiness and peacefulness. I know what I have to do. I know what I can do. I can always change the world, even a little. That place in me will always live on, a dream that burns so bright that even the worst of evil could not touch. Sometimes when I would look down at my feet, I could see that trace of grey stretching out from my shadow, consuming everything in every direction, and that blue house will be there, waiting for me. I am ready.\n",

      "A cloud of dust rises in the air as I open the rosewood box. It has been shelved since grandpa introduced Chinese shadow puppetry to me at the age of 7. The multicolored paper figures, carefully attached to the rods, now bring me back those childhood memories.\\  \"Come here, Yalin. Do you want to be a puppet artist like me? You can tell the stories of ancient heroes and heroines to all of your audience.\"\\  Kind of rebellious at that time, I just wanted to contradict grandpa. \"But why do I have to tell others stories instead of my own?\"\\  Grandpa looked at my face in surprise, \"then be a writer! I've been acting out others' stories on stage all my life. I'd be so proud of you if your own stories are adapted to amazing puppetry scripts someday.\"\\  \"He's just so obsessed,\" I murmured to myself, but grandpa's words seeded a brilliant idea in me: why not try writing? Just imagine how wonderful it would be if my articles got published! I sprinted home with great excitement and devoted myself to writing since then.\\  However, none of the 20 articles I sent out got published. None. Envious of the journalists who were even younger than me, I began to doubt myself and eventually changed the strategy. I referred to others' stories and then adapted theirs to my own. Surprisingly they got published more and more frequently. Though sometimes I felt guilty and insecure, whenever I saw my name in the newspaper, the false sense of accomplishment overruled.\\  Such insecurity eventually turned to a nightmare one day, when I was asked to read my essay to the whole class. It was a sad story about my brother's traumatic death, who in fact did not exist at all. It was inspired by a novel I recently read and I just readapted the story to mine.\\  It was my turn to read. I gripped my paper, walked to the podium, and took a deep breath.\\  \"My brother died...of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone and Osteosarcoma...at the age of 10.\"\\  Silence reigned. Every eye in the classroom focused on me, waiting for me to continue. Their eyes, telling of their expectation of my story, cut my face like a knife. With my voice trembling, I could not help lowering my head.\\  That night I decided to cross out all the contents in my essay that were irrelevant to my real experience. Surprisingly, all that remained were just hundreds of \"I\"s. Without the fake stories, my essay was actually an empty shell, just as a puppet without human emotion. Suddenly, I thought of the wistfulness grandpa exhibited when he told me that he had been narrating others' stories throughout his life.\\  Why do I have to tell others' stories instead of my own? That is the question I asked at the age of 7, and it sounds so ironic now. I devoted myself to writing because I could share the daily matters and my genuine feelings with others; however, under the sway of others, I had nearly forgotten this original intention of writing. Maybe it was time to find my own voice.\\  Now opening the rosewood box again, I recall my ignorance when grandpa said those words to me. He was actually encouraging me to be an original writer, just as a creator who endows the puppets with human emotion.\\  I stick the paper puppet on the rod.\\  I spread out the paper on my desk.\\  I set the screen and light.\\  I prepare my pen and ink.\\  I stand behind the curtain and wave the string.\\  I express the simplest emotion through my own story.\n",

      "The battles I have faced, the enemies I have conquered, and the challenges I have overcome are not who I am. They are merely the staircases that have brought me to today. \\\\I push my spine as far back into the crisp leather as it will go. I curl my knobby knees into my chest and twist my arms around them in an effort to keep my tiny frame all in one piece. I feel disturbingly out of place as my cold, grey body contrasts the warm, yellow room around me. I am vaguely aware of a polka dot rug below my feet, but my vision blurs it out to focus on the splash of my salty tears against the couch. A faint buzzing is floating to my ears and I do my best to try and understand the sound. It takes me too much effort to identify that the sound in the room is coming from the set of large pink lips seated before me on the other side of the glass coffee table. \"Emily\", continues the voice \"can you hear me?\" Someone has told me the name of the man who owns this voice a hundred times but I struggle to remember much of anything lately. \\\\I look up quickly and shallowly from the stains my salty eye droplets have left and scan the man, perceivably some sort of doctor. \"You need to understand that this eating disorder is going to be a part of your life forever. It's not going anywhere, but that doesn't mean you get to stay sick.\"  Despite my then dwindling ability to store important events, I will never forget that morbid mantra. At the time, the asserted fact that my eating disorder was going to be a part of my life forever seemed like a death sentence, and frankly, I wasn't too concerned with that possibility. \\\\Just a few months later I am sitting across the table from a starkly different individual.  I am nestled into the back corner of a bustling, red and black, glossy pizza parlor. My present company is a boy with gold for eyes and diamonds for teeth. He is smiling at me and our fingers are laced together as he promises to show me the best spot to see the stars. I am so happy I might faint. Until suddenly my mind involuntarily begins crunching numbers and spitting out shocking results. 634. 634. 634. Once my brain registers how many calories I have just consumed I can't stop myself from shaking and crying. I sprint out the restaurant. I stop just long enough to tell the perfect boy I don't feel well and I run the long route home. Instead of admiring the sky I spent the remainder of that night hugging the porcelain bowl in the bathroom, emptying out my gluttonous stomach. Once again, I have been reminded that my eating disorder will be with me for the rest of my life. My obsession with perfection has ruined my ability to enjoy some of life's most beautiful pleasures. I think I might be stuck in my own personal hell of disorders and imperfections forever. \\\\Today, though, is different. I have let myself breathe easily and smile with the pull of the ocean's tide.  I have learned to cherish every moment and appreciate the fickle, fleeting nature of 'perfection'. I understand now that happiness does not come from attempting to chisel a flawless version of myself but, rather, happiness stems from being able to build a version of myself that can love, laugh and live. No matter the past.\n",

      "My small hands clenched its neck. Desperately trying to shorten its lifespan, I unleashed a torrent of poorly coordinated kicks on its head.\\\\Flaunting neon pink strings, my tennis racket refused to break. I snatched it up, swung it over my head, and with all the force my 10-year-old arms could muster, smashed it against the net post. \\\\\"Sabrina! What's the matter with you?!\"\\\\My mother's scolding brought my attack to a halt.\\\\\"The strings are PINK!\" I wailed, bursting into tears-not because my mother was clearly upset, but because there was no way those strings were going to break.\\\\I'd skipped into practice eagerly anticipating sophisticated black strings on my freshly strung racket. But now, my hopes of gaining the instant acceptance and approval of my entirely male team were crushed along with my fantasies of hitting the ball with awe-inspiring force and precision.\\\\\"What's the issue? It was so sweet of your coach to get you colored strings. They usually cost extra.\"\\\\\"They're PINK!\"\\\\And they would, I was convinced, serve as a constant reminder to the boys that I was different, not equal... a girl. All the work I had done to distance myself from my femininity-always keeping my hair back, deliberately dirtying my sneakers, maintaining a tough, rowdy facade-would now be undermined.\\\\My performance in the practice that followed was utterly atrocious.\\\\\"Oh, honey, don't worry about it,\" my mother tried to comfort me. \"You were just upset.\"\\\\But I was certain it was because of those pink strings. Pink was girly and everyone knew that girly meant weak, frail, and delicate.\\\\It came as no surprise to me that the next practice went no better. Or the next. Or the one after that.\\\\The more time I spent playing with that pink-strung racket, the more disengaged from tennis I became. Why bother being focused when my pink strings guaranteed failure?\\\\\"Sabrina!\" my doubles partner shouted during a game one day, alerting me to the presence of the ball just inside the line on my side of the court.\\\\As much I wanted to let that ball die without making a futile effort, my partner was counting on me. A quick sprint and a desperate swing. It should have been an impossible hit, but somehow the ball was speeding across the net and over the fence.\\\\It was out, of course, but the sheer force with which I had hit the ball shocked me. Clearly it wasn't the color of the strings that was affecting my performance. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that not only was pink just a color, but also \"girl\" just a label. One that defined nothing more than my biology.\\\\With that in mind, I stopped worrying about how my actions would be perceived. I could root for the Buffalo Bills and indulge in my love of shoes, wear ratty t-shirts and wear floral dresses, refuse to paint my nails and fuss over my hair.\\\\From that point on, whenever my racket needed to be re-strung, it was with pink strings. And even though I've long since given up competitive tennis, when I need a reminder that labels are just labels, I pull it out, head to the court, and hit the ball over the fence.\n",

      "\"Can you go check on the infusion, it feels weird.\" My dad asks me weakly, \"It's going very slowly but still hurting my arm.\"\\\\Two days ago he insisted on eating meat, only to vomit 10 minutes later. I lift my tired eyes from my phone. He must be delusional from being in a hospital bed for so long, I mutter to myself. \\\\Just then, the nurse reappears. \"Can I help you to the bathroom?\" she asks politely. \\\\\"You're not my nurse. Get Ms. Tang for me. Now.\"\\\\This has been life for the last four and a half months-Saturday evenings spent with nothing but sterile white walls, the buzz of fluorescent light bulbs, and my father, who is slipping away. The silence is bearable, but my father's frailty is not. \\\\Dad had always been healthy-broad shoulders, bright eyes. One day, he collapsed in the street after lunch; we were told it was rectal cancer. My father was in pain, but I was numb, numb to the painful realities of illness and the ephemeral nature of life. With no premonitions, I treated my fathers' requests as if they were chores. \\ \\\"I told you to look at the infusion, Qi.\" Frustrated with my laziness, he pulls the needle from his arm. \"Get me my medicine.\"\\\\I pick up the glossy white bottle, hand him the pills, and watch him swallow. Absentmindedly reading the carefully printed label as I put the bottle back in place, I notice that the \"Patient's Name\" is wrong. Despite the unintelligible scribble, I can tell the last name is not \"Wang.\" Definitely not.\\\\Dad pushes the red \"Emergency Button.\" Patients in other beds look over. The ward is in chaos.\\\\I almost killed my Dad after cancer failed to do so. \\\\While waiting for him to receive treatment after the accident, I cry for the first time since his sickness. As I sit in the waiting room, the walls begin to suffocate me. Reality slowly sinks in as I replay the past in my head, reliving every painstaking second of the last 20 minutes. If he died, it would be my fault; I had taken the poison and put it in his hand. I had watched it slide down his throat. \\\\Ms. Tang comes outside, a serious expression on her face. He is going to be okay, she announces.\\\\Since the accident, a lot has changed. I grew up while sitting along the wall of that hospital hallway in quiet unease as I waited to hear the verdict on his life. I wondered if maybe my numbness was reflective of immaturity, an inability to face the world and its very real problems. \\\\It is Saturday morning, another night spent, as usual, in the hospital. As the early sunlight peers through the shades, my eyes open. The silence is broken by my fathers' voice. \"Can you check the infusion, Qi?\" After readjusting the tube, I scoot my chair close to his bed, setting my hand atop his. He clasps my warm fingers in his clammy palms. \"Dad, you want to hear my favorite K-Pop song?\" I ask, breaking the silence and the ice.\n",

      "Few of my childhood memories reflect positively the actions of my grandparents.  For as long as I can remember, the concept of forgiveness lingered like a foul taste in my mouth.  When I closed my eyes, I could see the disapproval in theirs, and when I plugged my ears I could hear the echoes of their criticism.  I can remember a trip to their secluded cottage, yet the parts that protrude in my mind are not the landscapes of pine trees and salty and stretches of soft, white sand.  Stuck in my mind like a fly in molasses was the chore contract that I was forced to sign.  Every time I played my clarinet, I was painfully reminded of my grandmother's harsh words.  \"Your sister is more talented, because cello is harder to play\", a non-musician had jabbed.  All I had wanted was appreciation; I would have been crazy to ask for love.  \\It is no mystery, then, why I was not wholeheartedly thrilled when my family arranged to spend two weeks under my grandparents' roof.  I dreaded the thought of, once again, looking into my grandmother's eyes and seeing nothing but disinterest and biting my tongue in the throes of another one of my grandfather's lectures. \\  The feeble man who answered the door was not my grandfather; this man greeted me with a hug.  In the heart of the house, I discovered a woman who resembled my grandmother, whom I greeted politely.  She did not respond.  Her eyes were a paler blue than I had remembered, and they carried a strange sort of blank energy.  My grandfather would later disclose to me the condition of his wife; my grandmother could still perceive and think, but she could not speak. \\One night,  I could tell that my grandmother was staring at me.  Suddenly, I felt a frail hand touch my back.  I looked back, and sure enough, my grandmother was wrapping her trembling arm around me.  I could not remember the last time that she had shown any affection for me, so I cautiously wrapped my arm around her shoulders, and we stood in silence for a few fragile moments.  It felt as if butterfly had landed on my finger- like the slightest movement would shatter the phenomenon- so I held her close and held my breath.  I searched the eyes which had for so long perplexed me, and let my pride falter.  The message became startlingly clear. \"I am sorry\".  My wall crumbled.  All of those years of pain and bitterness, every moment spent in dark resentment were washed away by three unspoken words.  I smiled, and, for the first time, I told the truth in saying to her, \"I love you\".  Impossibly, her face brightened, and in a faint, shaky voice, she said, \"yes\".\\Through all her stubborn spite, aching pain, and disability, my grandmother wished only for forgiveness and love.  I can only hope to, one day, be as brave.\n",

      "I feel the sweat dripping down my face as the spotlight shines on me. Suddenly, my hand slips, and I miss my next note. My eyes flash open as I try to get back on track. My mind is going wild as I see the rows of unfamiliar faces watching me screw up.\\            After playing the final note, I hurry off stage, wishing to get out of the hall as soon as possible. However, my parents decide it is a great idea to stay and watch everyone else's performance. They drag me over to a seat in the front row, making me suffer through one perfect performance after another. Finally, when the performances finish, my parents go and talk to each performer, congratulating them on their performances, while I sulk in a corner, criticizing my performance. All of a sudden, a couple of families walk over to me and praise me for a job well done. I was especially surprised when Eric, who performed beautifully, told me that my performance was amazing, and that I should stop criticizing myself. \"People come to have a good time, not to notice your every wrong note,\" said Eric.\\            That night I thought over what Eric said. I thought about how happy he looks whenever he plays. He makes it seem so effortless. Could it be that all these years I'd been miserable on stage because I was afraid of making a mistake? Instead of worrying about messing up, and wondering what the audience would think of me, I should have been thinking about sharing my love of music. I could think of my audience as guests in my living room, rather than as harsh judges hanging on every wrong note. My desire to deliver a perfect performance made me forget a basic fact about why I play the cello: its sound moves me like nothing else. The sound is the song of my soul. It gives me great joy. How could I have forgotten this?\\            Two weeks later, I had a solo in my spring concert. I was extremely nervous as the thought of messing up kept haunting me. But, remembering Eric's words, I decided to just have fun making music. I strode confidently onto the stage, cello in my left hand, bow in my right, and sat down. With the first note, I was feeling the music as though for the first time, and I could feel the audience resonating with the sound. After the last note, I opened my eyes and saw a sea of smiling faces.\\            After the performance, a family friend noted how calm I was and how much fun I seemed to be having. Now whenever I play, I remember that it's all about sharing something beautiful and that I deliver a better listening experience if I'm having fun myself.\n",

      "The lights were suddenly turned off, the door was shut behind me, and all I could hear was, \"take the boy, take the boy!\"  During my adolescence, my cousins and older sister, Andrea, were my biggest tormentors; they were the monsters that I was afraid of finding under my bed.  \\When I was four years old, my cousin Jonathan dressed up as Ghost Face, the psycho-killer from the slasher-flick Scream.  It's always good when you can find multiple uses for holiday accessories outside of their season; Jonathan proved it when he chose to use the mask of that costume to scare the living crap out of me every time I went over to his house.  One would think that such a cheap trick would lose its potency after a few occurrences, but this was not the case, because even after Jonathan became bored of his joke-I kept on being afraid of it!    To this day he still teases me about getting \"the mask\" out of the closet.\\Perhaps the most traumatizing trick that my cousins played on me was when I was three years old.  My cousins Miguel, Mercy, and Matthew came with my aunt to visit us.  All three of them were around the same age as my sister Andrea.  That day while I was watching TV in the living room, all four of them went to my sister's room.  Sometime later, Matthew came to invite me to Andrea's room.  As we walked into the room, the lights suddenly went off and the door slammed shut behind me.  Next thing I knew, Matthew, Mercy, and Andrea were holding me down facing towards Miguel as he bowed before an open closet, chanting and calling forth a demon to \"take the boy, take the boy!\"  This all climaxed when Miguel began pretending to be pulled into the closet by the demon while the other three pushed me in with him.  Luckily, my mom and aunt heard my screams and they rushed to my rescue.\\Because of these experiences, I hardly ever watched horror movies or went into haunted house attractions with my friends due to my deep rooted fears.  Then it all changed in the seventh grade when I went to a friend's birthday party.  He had rented the movie Insidious, which had been declared, by many of our friends, as being insanely scary.  I decided to be brave and watch it with them; the way I saw it, the worst case scenario was that I was not going to be able to sleep for two days.  Well, as it turns out, I found myself not only unafraid, but immensely entertained.  In fact, while my friends were shouting out of fear, I was genuinely trying to hear what the characters were saying.  After this event, I found myself watching more horror movies and not being as scared as I was when I was three.  \\Now, I laugh when I think about my cousins' and sister's old pranks, because I understand that cheap tricks like evil spirits and hauntings are nothing but that-cheap tricks; and for this discovery, I have only my family to thank.\n",

      "With the dirges lingering in the ears, the black throng moved slowly into the house to say goodbye to my great-grandmother. Following the crowds, I moved mechanically. Surrounding the coffin, kneeling to the elders, giving out flowers, the funeral tradition in China is perplexed, so was my thoughts. Actually, great-grandmother was both familiar and unfamiliar to me. She took care of me during my first four years from birth; however, she was also unknown to me, birth, job, experience or even the name. \\\\\"It's your turn.\" My mom whispered. I suddenly woke up from my memories and walked on the stone stairs. An old-looking but special red door stood on the last stair, bearing the flowers and a big photo as if that was her home. I stared at it and pieces of scenes burst out in my mind. My great-grandmother was sitting on the steps of her old house with smoke flying out of her mouth. Suddenly, I appeared, running out of the room, then jumping onto the door with my hand grasping the knockers and foot putting on the bottom of the door. She's frightened by me and shouted \"Dangerous! Get down from the door!\" Against the yells, I just pushed hard to make the door slid further like riding on a swing. And then she would quarrel with me just like a kid. However, she would no longer speak let alone quarreling with me. \\\\After the funeral, I sat beside my grandma and tried to comfort her. However, her murmurs just reminded me about those faded love that great-grandmother gave me.  I still remember that morning when I answered the doorbell, I just found my grandmother smiling there with her tired face. I can't believe that she came to our house just for taking a glance at me at her eighty years old. A decade later, I got the fact she waked up at four o'clock and made my favorite delicious food for me. However, she was lost on the road. She took bus for two hours and tried her best to walk towards our home according to her memory. Several hours later, she eventually reached our home and gave me that big surprise. I never realized that my great-grandmother cares me so much before. I was regret that I had done nothing filial respect towards her, even telling her that I love her very much.\\\\Never begin to treasure your loves till you could only pick up the fragments they left in memories. .After the funeral of my great-grandmother, I suddenly realized that truth. I used to deem my parents as invincible supermen, however they are not. They are trying to devote their endless love to me within their limited life. Maybe I can't find the way to fight against the rule of nature, but I want to be the person who can do more something for the beloved people around me and tell them my love, which is also my dream.\n",

      "The smell of disinfectant wipes and Crayola paint drifts in as I take a seat next to my peers. I glance around the classroom noting the crisp scaly skin that Nigel, the pet snake, has just shed. I am shaken from my thoughts as the teacher begins talking and asks us to look outside, and draw exactly what we see. \\\\I turn my head to the giant window on my right and look out. All I see is the dark hot asphalt, the dry lifeless field, and rows upon rows of trees. I get to work and furiously start coloring away on my paper. I look out the window again and notice the sky. It is the same as always, a brilliant shade of light blue littered with clouds throughout. I start to color in the sky, stopping about a third of the way down from the page. Content with my drawing, I call my teacher over to get his approval.\\\\Mr.Roels is not your average kindergarten teacher. He has piercings on each ear, and a unique collection of colorful tattoos crawling up his arm. He has a fascination with exotic animals shown through the pet snake and Komodo dragon in the classroom. When he comes over, he looks at my paper slightly amused, and asks me to look outside again. I focus my gaze up to the sky but I do not see anything different. \\\\As I concentrate on the sky, Mr.Roels points out the window and asks me, \"Tell me, where does the sky stop?\" Clearly confused by the silly question, I point to the tip of the trees and say, \"Right there.\"\\\\\"Look closer and tell me if you can see the pretty shade of blue between the trees.\" Mr. Roels asks, gently nudging me to really find the sky outside the window. At first I shake my head. Obviously the sky cannot extend lower than the trees, but as I focus again, I see it. The pretty shade of blue is not just in between the trees but is everywhere; it fills in all the gaps and absorbs all the empty space between objects. My little five-year-old mind is blown. I cannot believe that this whole time I had thought the sky just belonged way up with the sun, moon, stars and the clouds. From that day on I have always given things a second look, and it opened my mind to different possibilities.\\\\When I think about it now, it seems silly that I ever thought about the sky that way, but to me it is was more than just learning about the sky and coloring in a picture. Sometimes what we think is not always right, and that there is more to it than what we know, as Huxley once said,  \"There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception\". From that one day in kindergarten, I've been able to understand others better, even if that means questioning my own beliefs.\n",

      "In the summer before my freshman year of high school, I took my first official programming class, learning the basics of Java. When high school started, I recall my endeavors in AP Computer Science with Data Structures; my teacher always emphasized the importance of good documentation and design techniques, so that other programmers can read the developed code. He once singled me out for my design work in a graphics project, and was in general impressed by the way I grasped the material, despite being only a freshman. My crowning achievement in that class, however, was my work making a fully functional version of Solitaire. It was my favorite game to design, because it had several rules and constraints (seven initial stacks of cards, alternating colors in face-up stacks, lots of ways to lose), and it introduced me to several new data structures that could help solve the problem (stacks, queues, and maps). \\\\As a sophomore, I was head Webmaster for my school's chapter of Future Problem Solvers, a club dedicated to the strategizing and formulation of potential solutions to hypothetical scenarios and challenges. I designed and developed the first public website for the club. After a thorough requirements analysis and design process with several meetings and revisions, I built the site using Drupal CMS, PHP, and CSS. With my school being the largest FPS chapter in the state of California, my work paved the way for subsequent designs not just to our school site but also to the web presence of CAFPS as a whole. \\\\The summer before my junior year, I participated in the Summer Science Program (SSP), a camp dedicated to the orbit determination and tracking of a near-earth asteroid. This experience gave me my first exposure to the application of computer science outside of the classroom. Instead of doing exercises just for their own sake, we were solving problems with the aid of our programs. We developed software to calculate the centroid of a star or asteroid given an image, generate a Least-Squares plate reduction (a fancy term for calculating the absolute position) of our asteroid, find all of the orbital elements of the asteroid, and finally track it in the past and future (known as ephemeris generation). \\\\In the last two years, I have taken three further advanced computer science courses. In the fall of my junior year, I took numerical methods, a course that built up numerical tools in order to simulate physical situations. The final project there was a simulation of an arbitrary number of celestial bodies in space, interacting over an extended period of time. It was truly heartwarming to see the developments of galaxies and solar systems in the model, as it proved that my code was capable of simulating the real world. Currently, I'm taking Expert Systems, an artificial intelligence class based on developing a basic condensed expert system based on the same techniques used in tech companies around us - just recently, we made a prototype expert system that was capable of playing 20 questions. \\\\However, my favorite computer science class has to be Neural Networks, a class that I took in the spring of my junior year. The class goes through the process of building up an elementary Artificial Neural Network, and using gradient descent algorithms to train the computer to distinguish and characterize a set of data. The course started by being able to simply distinguish the truth table for XOR (the exclusive OR function), and worked its way up to being able to recognize the faces of every senior in the graduating class of 2015. The best section of the course, however, was an intermediate project regarding Optical Character Recognition - the ability to distinguish digits and characters from each other. In the summer before my senior year, I attended an Artificial Intelligence summer camp at Stanford. Here, I improved my OCR network into a system that could recognize over 40,000 handwritten digits from 0-9 with over 90% accuracy. \\\\Overall, computer science has been my lifelong passion from basically the moment I was old enough to use one. Over time, I have grown to love the field because of the incredible power of the computer to solve the most complex problems in our society today, from cancer research to cleaning the environment.\n",

      "My dream is to develop 3D printing technology in a way that it can be used for mass manufacturing for wide range of products. Through participation in the research project in junior college education in Singapore, I was inspired to implement 3D printing beyond prototyping. \\As a child, I visited my father's factory where I had the chance to handle freshly made super abrasive grinding wheels of different sizes and shapes. That factory experience first sparked my curiosity in science. Since childhood, the dream of being an engineer to discover and make new things has been deeply engraved in my mind. \\As I learned more about design, materials, and manufacturing, I realized that 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that will change the future of manufacturing industry. 3D printing has the potential to become a precise, flexible, labor-saving tool for manufacturing objects with minimal material wastage for wide range of materials. Currently, 3D printing has been proven useful for prototyping purposes, but it is hardly used for mass manufacturing because of the low printing speed. \\In junior college I participated in various activities including social service projects, stage performances and academic programmes. One that particularly resonated with my future aspirations is my participation in Nanyang Research Programme. With the aim of exploring 3D printing, I choose the research topic on the feasibility of optical fiber preform fabrication by 3D printing and I was supervised by Professor Shum Ping P\\at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to plan and conduct experiments in NTU's laboratory to prove my theory. \\I started the research project from scratch by reading relevant research literature to gain fundamental knowledge about both 3D printing and optical fiber preform fabrication. After actively engaging conversations with my professor and his university students, I realized the importance of scoping my research for precise results. With the guidance of my supervisor, I deduced that it is feasible to use 3D printing to mass produce high precision optical fiber preform due to its small volume to counter the slow printing speed. With such discovery, there is greater flexibility in optical fiber fabrication in terms of the core structure. I understood that with the real life application of theory, which is the gist of engineering indeed brings tremendous benefits to humans in terms of improvement in productivity and enhancement in comfort. \\Personally, I truly enjoyed the research process in spite of the difficulties and challenges in understanding a completely unfamiliar field of study. After overcoming all the obstacles, I brought practical solutions to complex problems and expanded the total human pool of knowledge. Furthermore, what intrigues me more is unlimited imagination to come up with innovative and feasible solution to tackle problems. In engineering research, any possible idea of a solution is welcome but has to be substantiated by theory and experiments. \\Despite the difficulty in determining the precision of 3D printed products, I made used of optical measurement equipment to measure the surface roughness. Also, I found breakthrough of using thermalchromic material that changes color beyond a specific temperature as its unique property to assist the indication of power supply in the optical fiber as an additional benefit brought by 3D printing due to wide range of materials used in printing. \\Motivated by childhood factory experience and junior college science research project, I am looking forward to address real world challenges by coming up creative ideas to bring solutions to day to day problems of humans by translating theoretical knowledge into real life application.\n",

      "Math has been my favorite subject for as long as I can remember. Beginning with a simple fascination with numbers, my passion for the subject has expanded with my exposure to the field. From math competitions to undergraduate math topics, math has become a key part of my life.\\\\I was first introduced to math outside of standard school topics through middle school math competitions. Since then, math contests have become a constant in my life, exposing me to topics such as probability and number theory through problems on the AMC as well as through Math Prize for Girls and other contests, approximately a total of ten per year. To improve my abilities, I took the Art of Problem Solving's Worldwide Online Olympiad Training class in ninth and tenth grade and attended the AwesomeMath Summer Program in 2013; I still practice contest problems to help me solve them more effectively. As an officer in my school's Math Competitions Club both last year and this year, I have had the opportunity to help others improve in addition to improving myself. With the other officers, I run classes to aid people in qualifying for later rounds of the AMC competitions. Thus, math competitions have allowed me not only to learn non-school math and improve my problem solving skills but also to work with others and help them learn.\\\\While math contests have shown me many different types of problems, my self-study of math topics with some help from my parents or teachers has increased the strength of my mathematical foundation. I have used MIT OpenCourseWare to learn most of the material I have studied on my own. Using the site, I completed 18.02, a multivariable calculus class, and 18.06, a linear algebra class, in ninth and tenth grade, respectively, beginning the courses before I took them at school and working through them more thoroughly than the corresponding school classes did. During the second semester of junior year, I began studying probability according to 6.041 because I wanted to start learning useful undergraduate math topics. Among more unusual fields of math, I also watched some of the 6.849 lectures about folding because of my interest in origami. Outside of OpenCourseWare, I also self-studied some group theory using John Fraleigh's A First Course in Abstract Algebra for about three hours per week during first semester of my junior year. Overall, by learning math on my own outside of class, I have determined the best way to teach myself math and solidified my basic mathematical knowledge.\\\\Canada/USA Mathcamp, a five-week summer program, has also contributed to developing my mathematical ability beyond high school subjects. In 2014, a brief group theory class that I took there led me to self-study group theory, and other classes introduced me to concepts such as uncountable infinities and knot theory. During Mathcamp 2015, I had the opportunity to take classes relying on what I learned the previous year and to collaborate with other people to learn math. In one class, I spent two hours every day for five days working with a group of people to a guided proof of the Banach-Tarski Theorem; in another class, the other students and I collectively proved Abel's Theorem over the course of five weeks using a textbook's outline. As a result, through Canada/USA Mathcamp, I have had the chance to collaborate with others to learn math and to realize that collaboration makes math easier and more enjoyable.\\\\I love exploring math in all its forms and look forward to continuing to do so in the future. My experiences in math have taught me to appreciate the subject both for its applications to other areas and for its own sake. Additionally, math has allowed me to meet friends with whom I enjoy doing math, making math a social exercise as well as a mental one.\n",

      "The world of computer science allows me to use my creativity and innovativeness to solve complex problems and make a positive difference in society using technology. \\\\I have been interested in computer science since elementary school and it has become one of my greatest passions. In fourth grade, I learned HTML because I desired to create my own website. In sixth grade, I took a programming course hosted by a local college that introduced me to Scratch, a graphical and relatively simple programming language. After mastering Scratch, one of my friends introduced me to Python, another programming language. Afterwards, I learned the C++ programming language which is commonly used for creating games. In the calendar year of my sophomore year, I moved from Texas to Michigan. That year, as a representative for my new high school at the regional science fair competition, I entered a project which consisted of conducting a programming-based experiment using Python to study the various techniques that hackers use to crack passwords. I advanced to the Michigan state science fair competition and ended up being a finalist. This accomplishment served to fuel my passion for programming even more. As a result, I joined my high school's newly created robotics team and became a lead programmer. In my free time, I learned other programming languages as well. \\\\For last year's regional science fair competition, my experiment entailed studying the efficiency of sorting algorithms using C++. My project was eligible to be on display at the regional science fair competition; however, I declined that opportunity to participate in a robotics team competition which was held at the same time. I also learned the C programming language via participation in Harvard University's introductory computer science class CS50 through iTunes U. Additionally, I was a member of a team that participated in Carnegie Mellon University's annual picoCTF computer security national competition and have created programs on my calculator that automate the law of cosines, simplify radicals, and perform decimal to binary conversions, among other things. One personal project I am currently engaged in involves developing a program that will convert songs on YouTube videos to MP3 files and create ID3 tags and download album art for the songs as well. I have also started iOS development and I am creating my first app that will be released on the App Store. \\\\There is no computer science curriculum currently offered at my school. Therefore, I am starting a computer programming club with a goal of helping participants gain a foundation in computer science and learn fundamental programming skills essential to developing real-world applications. I also completed a computer science course at Harvard Summer School this past summer to supplement practical knowledge gained from self-study with theoretical concepts taught by experts in the computer science field. \\\\My long-term career aspiration involves starting my own software development company. In order to achieve this goal, it is my desire to study computer science at a highly regarded university to develop a strong educational background. I seek to develop a strong foundation in machine learning and artificial intelligence and apply that knowledge to drive technological advances and pursue my ultimate goal of creating intelligent systems that will benefit humanity.\n",

      "After debugging, testing and debugging my code again, the collection of my coding statements had finally come to fruition. As the preview window popped up, I awaited the digital duplication of Mastermind, the board game, to appear on my screen. The lines that designated spaces slowly appeared in front of me; I was ecstatic to finally witness my first program materialize my vision.\\\\At a very young age, I was introduced to programming and was amazed that simply writing what seemed to be basic lines of code statements could result in the expression of my creative ideas. This encouraged me to spend more time learning how to program so I could continue my passion for creativity. Learning more about various coding languages online like python and java, I was quickly exposed to a new world. I could now form simple lines of code together to create complex visuals. After watching several tutorials, I witnessed the culmination of my work appear on the screen in front of me. The world of creativity I pursued was now infinitely larger than before; I was no longer limited to just thinking about games as a participant, but instead, was now able to create a world for other's entertainment.\\\\Completing my first project, Mastermind, and my subsequent projects, I realized that becoming the first software engineer in my family was the career I wanted to pursue. As a child, creating and experimenting with computers was the world I lived in. With my early experiences coding and my recent internship at Blizzard Entertainment, I have been lucky enough to already begin fulfilling my childhood dreams. While at Blizzard I had the opportunity to shadow several developers of various games and learned that teamwork was necessary in the process of creating new concepts and the combination of these concepts to create new content. From this I learned the importance of communicating one's goals to colleagues to resolve potential problems that may pop up, a desirable skill in a design team leader. \\\\Eventually I would like to become a lead for a team of designers to create content for players and ensure that the content has a learning curve. The content would allow experienced players to utilize the content more efficiently than inexperienced players. With this idea in mind, I also want to create content where the difference in player skill creates a marginal advantage, but not one large enough to deter the user from learning. Currently, I am challenging myself to understand new C++ language, strong data structures, logic and algorithm skills in preparation for my future education and career. If I aspire to be a creative programmer, I must understand the intricacies of how to make digital worlds become more vibrant while also enhancing and making games and or programs more aesthetically appealing to users. Additionally, I will need the experience of working with other aspiring developers in university to hone the necessary team building skills to be an effective leader.\\\\I am glad that I learned how to create programs with various coding languages from a young age, as it has encouraged my imagination and expanded my ability to create and share my ideas with others. With computers, I am no longer limited to what I can imagine and then design, whether it be programs to help people study or simply for their entertainment. The potential for creation through computers is unlimited, and it is what keeps me returning to the drawing board. It helps me reimagine how to improve efficiency and interface; and it is what absolutely fascinates me.\n",

      "I believe that one's goals derive from one's passions and one's surroundings, and that these aspirations are not static, but evolve over time.  I currently hope to develop new technologies to improve people's lives using concepts I will learn while pursuing my electrical engineering degree.\\\\My academic passions are math, science and, more recently, engineering. My parents have always encouraged me to participate in a variety of activities and explore my passions.  The Awty International School has provided me with numerous opportunities to explore these passions and learn important skills that will be instrumental in achieving my aspirations. \\\\I have had strong mentors at Awty who have encouraged me to take my passions to a deeper level and participate in competitions and activities that are stimulating and help me discover how to channel my talents. I believe these are crucial steps as I explore and formulate plans for my future education and training, and eventually my life's work.  Some of these activities are described below.\\\\One of the activities that has shaped me is robotics. Robotics teaches an understanding of machines and the application of new concepts in order to complete a given task.  A knowledge of robotics is transferable to several other engineering disciplines, including electrical. Robotics also taught me to work in a team environment towards a common goal.\\\\Additionally, I have played chess competitively in elementary and high school. Chess fosters critical thinking and strategic planning. People often use the phrase \"thinking several moves ahead\" which originates from chess. The determination to concentrate on a single game, which can last up to four hours, is definitely a skill that has helped me with long tasks.\\\\Another activity that has influenced me is my involvement in student council. The leadership skills that I have learned will be essential to manage people effectively, unite team members under a common goal, and create an outcome that no individual could attain. \\\\For my academics, I chose Awty's IB program because of its rigor and extensive preparation for more difficult college courses. I chose Higher level physics, because I enjoy discovering the physical laws that govern everyday life. This course has been both beneficial and intriguing since a full term has been devoted to electronics, including circuits, resistors, and capacitors.  In addition to taking Higher Level Math, Chemistry and Physics, I was selected to take a college-level linear algebra course during my free periods. Since this course is taken in college by all engineers, it has opened my mind to the great expanse of mathematical knowledge that I have yet to learn.\\\\I have also participated in several career-oriented activities so that I can understand more about engineering and business in general. Upon the recommendation of my advisor, I attended the UT San Antonio Engineering Camp where I learned about eight engineering disciplines. It was here that I first discovered my passion for electrical engineering.  On the electrical engineering day, we created some basic circuits that would perform simple tasks.  We also heard about far more complex applications of electrical engineering, in the fields of energy, information and health.  I realized that for me, electrical engineering had both the breadth of applications and the depth of learning that I could not only build a career around, but could be a platform for solving major problems that face society.\n",

      "The 21st century is the golden age of technology. Computers are ubiquitous, and many people are captivated by their ability to solve complex problems in a fraction of a second. I am no exception. My interest sparked in 5th grade when my father, a system architect, showed me the code for a simple application. The program only multiplied two numbers together, but its ability to simulate human-like processing with so few lines of code captivated me. This marked the beginning of my aspiration to study computers.\\    In the beginning of 9th grade, I began to lose interest in programming. The knowledge I had gained from watching videos online was very basic, so I started to think of the subject as redundant and restrictive. My school did not offer AP Computer Science at the time, so I focused on mathematics, my favorite subject in school. The most appealing aspect of the subject was its precision; unlike problems in other classes--which frequently require students to try many different approaches--there is often only one correct answer to a math problem. My precalculus class eventually reached proofs, and I was fascinated by their ability to generalize problems and solutions. This new concept also reignited my interest in computers. Not the programming aspect, but instead the theory side of computers: computer science. I looked online for something similar to proofs in computer science and found Topcoder, an online algorithm competition. Before, my focus in computer science had been solely graphics, but the problems in Topcoder were pure logic. The solutions were like miniature proofs because I would have to prove that my program worked with any valid input for maximum credit. The difficulty lied in thinking of a solution rather than the actual programming, and I preferred it that way.\\  In the summer prior to junior year, I interned at the Monterey Institute of Research in Astronomy (MIRA). My internship focused on implementing the Hydrogen lines--of which 2/3 of the stellar atmosphere is comprised--into MIRA's Stellar Atmosphere Simulator. This was the first time I had applied computer science to a real-world problem, and I had to combine programming with advanced physics concepts. My experience in that portion of my internship confirmed my original belief that I prefer researching and creating new theorems rather than simply applying old ones.\\    I joined my school's robotics club during my junior year. I was considering computer engineering, a blend of electrical engineering and computer science, as a major, so I participated in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition to get a feel of what computer engineering was like. I decided to work on the programming and electronic systems, and I had the opportunity to single-handedly build these aspects of the robot because there were so few members on the team. Partway through the season, I realized computer engineering was much more complex than computer science and electrical engineering. When a problem occurred, it was difficult to determine whether the program or hardware was at fault. Because of this, I decided computer engineering was too tedious for my liking, and I discarded the possibility of it being my major.\\    Though many consider computer programming, computer science, and computer engineering to be equivalent, I find them to be very different. In middle school, I had known that my future would be related to computers; however, I did not know which subfield I would choose. These experiences have allowed me to narrow down my field of interest to just one branch of study--computer science.\n",

      "Raised in the Silicon Valley, I grew up in a world characterized by technology and focused on efficiency. This world has exposed me to many situations in which I needed to \"work smarter, not harder,\" implementing any tools necessary to become faster and better at a task. However, in the beginning, I received all of the help that I needed from elsewhere; it did not occur to me that I could someday create these tools on my own, or that my creations could be useful to others. Over the years, computer science has shown me that possibility.\\\\My high school community consists of a few hundred students at the mercy of two forces: studying and playing games. Recognizing this, my Java teacher assigned the task of building an educational game to be used in another class. At the time, I wondered how a simple computer program written by a teenager in just a few weeks could be useful. Nevertheless, when I presented to my Pre-calculus teacher a math game that had the player identify conics equations and offered a game of Tic-Tac-Toe for every correct answer, she remarked that it was enjoyable to use. However, what pleased me the most was that my friends and I were able to use it to learn the formulae ourselves and review for exams. Though rudimentary, this game was the first tool that I had created on my own, and it showed me the capabilities of computer science and the possibilities that it offers.\\\\Since then, I have continued to use programming as a tool. My AP Statistics class has often had group assignments to run repeated trials of a simulation using a calculator's random integer generator. After going through the experiment once by hand, I coded and ran the process multiple times to check for consistency, making sure that my group's data was accurate and saving needless hours of work. I began to see the utility of coding as a means to streamline work for efficiency. This time, I had noticed the need for such a tool and taken the initiative to create it myself. \\\\This summer, I took a three-week Maya 3D modeling course at the University of Pennsylvania. Although my professor taught using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) perspective of the software, I spent my spare time deciphering the Script Editor code written in Maya Embedded Language (MEL) and Python. Although it is possible to use Maya through only the editor, the GUI allows the software to be useful even to people without any coding background. People who do not understand MEL or Python can still use Maya, relying on graphic input such as selecting and dragging to physically move a model or frame. Through this process, I realized how effective computer science is in allowing tools to be powerful and universal. By making my tools with an accessible user interface, I have the potential to create programs with widespread appeal.\\\\For most of my life, I have relied on tools created by others to improve efficiency. However, with computer science, I can be more influential and create my own applications, ideas that better fit my needs and those of others in today's technology-driven world. With further exploration of this field, I hope to someday create software like Maya that is widespread and can be utilized by any user, allowing my creations to be useful to a larger world. This is a goal that I can best achieve through computer science.\n",

      "My school has consistently been a hub for innovation, breeding many of the worlds top entrepreneurs. In this environment I became fascinated with innovation. I was inspired to take on many challenges where I did extraordinary things both in and outside of school. At university, I want to gain the skills to take a  groundbreaking and transformative product to market. \\\\One of the key parts of my high-school career has been the leadership roles I've pursued. I joined the FIRST Robotics team in grade nine and, within a year, became the youngest executive, in charge of sponsorship, marketing, award presentations and team management. At the world championships for Robotics, I sharpened my interpersonal skills by promoting our product to other teams, multinational corporations, and judges. By grade eleven, I had been appointed Sponsorship Head, and became the lead coordinator for FIRST Canada's \"RoboJam,\" a North-American wide event attended by approximately 400 people. I became excited about the managerial side of technological innovation while working behind-the-scenes at an international event, and inspiring a team working on new ideas in robotics, This year, I'm applying this enthusiasm to my new role as Vice President of marketing for the DECA, Investment and Case Competition teams. \\\\Alongside all my leadership activities, I have tackled challenging computer programming in the hopes of understanding the complex apps that are so prevalent in today's world. Eager to share my addiction to Java coding with my peers, I created the first programming competition in my school's history (the questions I authored were later incorporated into the grade eleven and AP computer science curriculum). I proceeded to found and become president of the Crescent School Programming Club, where I expanded my programming knowledge by publishing two Android applications, \"Coyote Connection\" and \"CoyoScout\" to Google's Play Store. These days, I'm learning new programming languages, creating a more sophisticated city-wide programming competition, continuing application development, and creating websites.\\\\I have used my interest in innovation towards addressing all kinds of problems in my school and community. When my robotics team ran short on funds, I launched an online store to increase fundraising ventures. After noticing a shortage of computer science programs across Canada, I created a non-profit organization called Canada Learns Coding to increase the national involvement in Google's Hour of Code. We connected computer scientists with students of all ages from over 100 schools. The project gave me invaluable experience managing a national program from start to finish.\\\\The management course I took at Cornell University, and the economics course I took at Harvard, earned me As and recommendation letters from my professors. Success in these courses solidified my determination to pursue a rigorous undergraduate degree in business. With the skills I have acquired, and the numerous awards I have received for my academic performance and contributions to school-life, I know I can thrive in both a demanding undergraduate environment and in technology-driven business world.\n",

      "Having been fascinated with science and engineering since I was a little girl, I observe everything curiously. Under the profound impact of my father, an engineer majoring in Electrical Engineering, I became increasingly interested in electronics and computers. I used to spend the whole afternoon watching him assembling the mainframe, thereby recognizing the names of hardware components. Later, I would assemble my own mainframe or advise my friends on laptops. Specifically, the computer displaying colorful images and the Internet bringing people much closer engender my great enthusiasm and curiosity to research them. I have thus absorbed diverse knowledge in related disciplines in science and engineering from school and personal activities.\\\\During my high school years, I always wonder how to optimize the performances of electronic devices, thus further increasing my interest in Electrical Engineering. Performances can be improved in hardware and software. Laptops can gain their portability by supplanting input and output like the keyboard, display and sound equipment with virtual laser projection keyboard, 3D holographic projection and Bluetooth headset. Thus, computers can be as small as books. Such compacting will have a groundbreaking influence on multifarious objects: from laptops to 3D printers, to be portable. However, realizing such a whimsy requires interdisciplinary knowledge to overcome obstacles in hardware, software, and energy. University of California's course options suit the requirements perfectly. As your school's strengths lie in interdisciplinary studies, I will capitalize on the cross-disciplinary education while focusing on Electrical Engineering, and minor in Materials or Chemistry to be well prepared for a curriculum supporting my interests.\\\\Completing the curriculum requirements for my intended majors would help me become an innovative engineer. Additionally, I am also interested in psychology. As an engineering student, I am also eager to understand human mind and psychological behaviors to be aware of the impact of advanced technology on public. Furthermore, your school's flexible curriculum perfectly aligns with my dream. \\\\Moreover, the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program in your college is appealing because it would allow me to easily interact with students, professors, and scientists from diverse fields to gain new perspectives. Nowadays, materials with electrical energy conversion properties are creating new ways to generate electricity from renewable energy sources. Batteries are not the best option for applications where environments are polluted. Thus, energy scavenging from environmental sources can be an alternative solution. Energy harvesting has become important recently because of the almost infinite lifetime and the non-dependency on fuels for clean-energy generation. By scavenging energy from sources like light and vibration, power can be generated. It is thus my dream and future research interest to design energy systems to protect humans from the environmental pollution with new green energy resources. \\\\With my passion for engineering, I believe I will do well in my college study. Most importantly, University of California is my top choice, where students pursue academics at the highest level and have a strong sense of school spirit.\n",

      "Living in such a culturally diverse state as California, paradoxes are ubiquitous. Diversity breeds paradoxes. The paradox that has been most prevalent in my life has been my parents' relationship and its enduring nature. \\\\At its basic level, my parents' relationship is a beautiful love story. My father was born in Tehran, Iran and was raised as a devout Muslim. Attending Islamic schools, he enrolled in the Iranian military to fight a religious war against Iraq during the 1980's. In contrast, my mother was born in a very impoverished community in East Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants. Raised with Catholic teachings, she once entertained the thought of becoming a nun in order to fulfill her religious duties. \\\\Indeed, my parents grew up in entirely different cultures, but as the old adage goes, opposites attract. Thankfully for me, the environment my parents cultivated has instilled within me a holistic, rich, and vibrant perspective. Specifically, my family's background has enhanced my cultural awareness and ability to accept others. My upbringing has not always been easy; my Iranian side of the family are devout Muslims and have very stringent standards for female behavior. Women are forbidden to dance, but dance is my passion. Women are not encouraged to pursue education, but I thrive in the academic sphere. Women are obedient, but I had the iron-clad will of my fierce Mexican mother. Women are not supposed to lead, but I shined in my role as a leader, winning president for ASB, junior, and sophomore class.\\\\That said, the tug-of-war within my identity had its fair share of challenges, challenges that I eventually overcame with a better and stronger sense of identity.  And although there have been these challenges, my cultural background is incredibly vibrant: I've celebrated Persian New Year and Cinco de Mayo, I've eaten Koobideh and tamales, and I've sipped on Chai and Horchata. Apart from this gastronomical adventure, I've developed a significant cultural awareness that has fostered my thirst to learn about different cultures and people. \\\\Such awareness was amplified when I was invited to join the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHHS), which has allowed me to gain valuable insight into different cultures and experiences. The NSHHS hosts global conferences. By attending these conferences, I've interacted with people from various continents. Through such interactions, I have learned compassion and how to work collaboratively with others. Because I'm interested in pursuing a career in government and politics, these conferences have furthered my desire to understand the inner-workings of government. I've met and conversed with eminent figures such as Al Gore and Condoleezza Rice, and have also had the privilege of attending both of President Obama's inaugurations. From these conferences, I've gained a deep knowledge of how governmental systems operate. More importantly, I gained a desire to study political science and focus on international affairs. \\\\I am drawn to the study of political science because public policy and government shape society. Whether it be the rate of taxes or international affairs, politics is rooted in and impactful to almost every aspect of life. Even when I volunteered to canvass for an incumbent campaigning for the Water Board District, I felt as though I was making an impact, albeit a small one.  I want to play an active role in forming public policy and in shaping society; I hope to bring passionate, logic-based ideas to the forefront of global politics. Furthermore, immersing myself in political science would give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of government and policy on both national and international levels. \\\\My desire to pursue political science taught me that while my Iranian-Mexican background has brought many trials, it has ultimately taught me important life lessons. It has challenged my beliefs and self-identity and instilled in me a fire. This fire drives me to learn, to explore, to be more than an Iranian-Mexican. It is a fire that will light the pathway for further intellectual growth and world discovery as an advocate and scholar within the realm of political science.  It is this fire that will inspire me to become a true agent of change.\n"
