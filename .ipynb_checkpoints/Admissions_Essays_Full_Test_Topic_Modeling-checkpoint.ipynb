    "# Analysing Admissions Essays: Unsupervised Approaches using scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notbook is designed to analyze every admissions essay submitted to Berkeley in the 2014-2015 academic year using Topic Modeling in Pythons scikit-learn package.  It begins with two CSV files (UTF-8) each containing unique and correspondeing dummie ID's for each of the two essay prompts that year.  There are column headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Statement 1\n",
    "1. Freshmen: Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.\n",
    "1. Transfers: What is your intended major? Discuss how your interest in the subject developed and describe any experience you have had in the field — such as volunteer work, internships and employment, participation in student organizations and activities — and what you have gained from your involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Statement 2\n",
    "1. Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are?\n",

      "Bojio!\\\\That was what I playfully typed on my family's Whatsapp group chat after my older brother posted a picture of his and my sister in law's Bali resort. It was an expression that travelled from my mind to my flitting fingertips almost immediately. The resort was simply the image of serenity and solitude- and which student going through examination stress would not want to be a part of that?\\\\It was only when I got home and slumped on the sofa that I saw the nervous look on my mother's face. Her kohl-rimmed eyes were wide and her vermillion adorned forehead scrunched up as she asked, utterly confused, \"What's bojio?\"\\\\I burst out laughing. Sometimes, I forgot how every day brought around a new culture shock when you lived in a traditional Indian family but grew up in a multiracial community. The Hokkien phrase \"bojio\", literally meaning \"never invite\", is a popular colloquialism in Singapore to teasingly express annoyance at not being invited to something. My brother, who has grown up in Singapore as well, would be familiar with it and probably retort with an impish reply making fun of my miserable situation. My parents, however, were dumbfounded.\\\\It was frustrating when I found it a challenge to explain this Hokkien phrase to my mother. I could tell her the definition, but not the feeling that came with it. So I illustrated it in a different context.\\\\\"Mummy, how would you feel if you found out your best friends went to a cricket match without you?\"\\\\She gasped.  For some Indians, not inviting your best friend to a cricket match is pretty much like not inviting them to your wedding.\\\\These experiences come daily when you speak not just two distinct languages, but a vibrant mix of many. Singlish is one of my favourite things about growing up in Singapore. I use Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and various other dialects regularly, sometimes without even realizing it. And with different languages come unique perspectives. When words like \"sian\", \"lepak\" and \"shiok\" roll off my tongue at home and I have to explain them, it is both slightly exasperating and extremely enlightening. It has made me realise language is a delightfully quirky part of culture, and I appreciate the diversity of communication that fills my life every day. It has made me respect and admire cultures, and made me sensitive to social nuances in an exceptional way.  \\\\The effects of my Indian upbringing also brim over to my experiences outside of home. Once, on Racial Harmony Day, I donned a traditional Indian salwar kameez and a bindi. My classmate asked what the dot on my forehead meant. It was not meant to be offensive, but I remember being taken aback. The bindi was anything but a mere dot. I recalled the trips my mother, aunts and I took to buy colourful bindis to give as presents to newly wedded women. The bindi was important to me, to my culture. But I could not explain why.\\\\I took it upon myself to ask my family members: my learned grandmothers, my upbeat aunts and some of my favourite cousins, but I never would have if I had not been questioned. It was a revelation indeed: perspective adds such astonishing complexity to everything. I found out that the bindi is not just cultural in meaning. There is a world of personal, religious and spiritual meaning behind it. From then on, I found myself hungry for multiple perspectives: be it articles about a political party or gossip about the newest relief teacher. \\\\I subsequently invited that classmate to a Diwali gathering at my house. Just then, my friend overheard us speaking and exclaimed, \"Diwali bojio?!\"\\\\I grinned at how my world resided in those two words.\n"

This is the building block for Topic Modeling and a number of other methods we may want to explore.  There are two ways to do this. We can turn it into a sparse matrix type, which can be used within scikit-learn for further analyses.  We can then turn it into a full documnet term matrix, but this is very memory intensive and might not be a great idea for larger data sets."

    "\n",
    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. We saw a few ways to this yesterday, using natural language processing. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: word scores. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is *tf-idf* scores. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",

      "Two of my greatest passions in life are sports and business. From childhood I was naturally inclined toward sports: to shoot hoops, play catch, and be involved in competition. On the other hand, my interest in business developed over time from observing my grandfather. My grandpa is considered a legend in Chicago Chinese restaurant history, starting over thirty restaurants throughout the Midwest. His entrepreneurial skills were inspirational, and early in my life Grandpa planted seeds in my mind that someday I would be his successor in the restaurant business. Although the specific dream of taking over the restaurants has faded, working there during my high school years has helped me understand the value of hard work and the benefits of running your own business - especially when it's doing something that you love.  The idea was that business can help you pursue your dreams.\\That idea was also emphasized in a significantly different experience. Last summer my mom started helping out at Full Package Athletics, one of the largest AAU travel basketball companies in the area.  We had become very friendly with the owner because my brothers and I all played on teams at Full Package. However, because of some transition in leadership, my mom volunteered to help run the business aspect of Full Package. While the owner was a great basketball coach and trainer, he was business challenged and didn't understand the importance of utilizing fundamental business principles to run the company. There was no clear plan for the future and no business model to follow. After almost a year trying to assist, my mom eventually parted ways with Full Package. Witnessing and hearing about my mom's experience helped me realize how important it was to understand business.  \\The lessons learned from my grandfather and mother have helped me form my future aspiration to eventually combine my two passions and own an international sports agency that represents the best athletes around the world.\n"
