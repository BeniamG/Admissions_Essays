    "# Analysing Admissions Essays: Unsupervised Approaches using scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two libraries that dominate text analysis in Python. The first is NLTK, which implements a range of natural language processing techniques (see other notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dominant library is scikit-learn, which, at its most basic, provides a function to create a memory-efficient document-term matrix. It also implements a variety of quite sophisticated machine learning techniques that you can use on your text. It's a powerful library well suited for many purpouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the approaches we will use below for our purpouses include:\n",
    "* word weighting\n",
    "* feature extraction\n",
    "* text classification / supervised machine learning\n",
    "    * L2 regression\n",
    "    * classification algorithms such as nearest neighbors, SVM, and random forest\n",
    "* clustering / unsupervised machine learning\n",
    "    * k-means\n",
    "    * pca\n",
    "    * cosine similarity\n",
    "    * LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll start with the Document Term Matrix (DTM). The DTM is the bread and butter of most computational text analysis techniques, both simple and more sophisticated methods. In this lesson we will use Python's scikit-learn package learn to make a document term matrix from a .csv Music Reviews dataset (collected from MetaCritic.com). We will then use the DTM and a word weighting technique called tf-idf (term frequency inverse document frequency) to identify important and discriminating words within this dataset (utilizing the Pandas package). The illustrating question: what words distinguish reviews of Rap albums, Indie Rock albums, and Jazz albums? \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will use the DTM to get an introduction to one method for uncovering patterns or themes within text: LDA, a topic modeling algorithm. Again, this will just be an introduction. Look for additional workshops in the future that will get into topic modeling in more detail.\n",

    "* *Document Term Matrix*:\n",
    "  * a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.\n",
    "* *TF-IDF Scores*: \n",
    "  *  short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "* *Topic Modeling*:\n",
    "  * A statistical model to uncover abstract topics within a text. It uses the co-occurrence fo words within documents, compared to their distribution across documents, to uncover these abstract themes. The output is a list of weighted words, which indicate the subject of each topic, and a weight distribution across topics for each document.\n",
    "* *LDA*:\n",
    "  * Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A implementation of topic modeling that assumes a Dirichlet prior. It does not take document order into account, unlike other topic modeling algorithms.\n",

    "First, we read our corpus, which is stored as a .csv file on our hard drive, into a Pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Pandas is great for data munging and basic calculations because it's so easy to use, and its data structure is really intuitive for me. It's not memory efficient however, so you might quickly need to move away from it. I recommend always always always using Pandas (or similar) over spreadsheets and Excel.

       "'Bojio!\\\\\\\\That was what I playfully typed on my family\\'s Whatsapp group chat after my older brother posted a picture of his and my sister in law\\'s Bali resort. It was an expression that travelled from my mind to my flitting fingertips almost immediately. The resort was simply the image of serenity and solitude- and which student going through examination stress would not want to be a part of that?\\\\\\\\It was only when I got home and slumped on the sofa that I saw the nervous look on my mother\\'s face. Her kohl-rimmed eyes were wide and her vermillion adorned forehead scrunched up as she asked, utterly confused, \"What\\'s bojio?\"\\\\\\\\I burst out laughing. Sometimes, I forgot how every day brought around a new culture shock when you lived in a traditional Indian family but grew up in a multiracial community. The Hokkien phrase \"bojio\", literally meaning \"never invite\", is a popular colloquialism in Singapore to teasingly express annoyance at not being invited to something. My brother, who has grown up in Singapore as well, would be familiar with it and probably retort with an impish reply making fun of my miserable situation. My parents, however, were dumbfounded.\\\\\\\\It was frustrating when I found it a challenge to explain this Hokkien phrase to my mother. I could tell her the definition, but not the feeling that came with it. So I illustrated it in a different context.\\\\\\\\\"Mummy, how would you feel if you found out your best friends went to a cricket match without you?\"\\\\\\\\She gasped.  For some Indians, not inviting your best friend to a cricket match is pretty much like not inviting them to your wedding.\\\\\\\\These experiences come daily when you speak not just two distinct languages, but a vibrant mix of many. Singlish is one of my favourite things about growing up in Singapore. I use Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and various other dialects regularly, sometimes without even realizing it. And with different languages come unique perspectives. When words like \"sian\", \"lepak\" and \"shiok\" roll off my tongue at home and I have to explain them, it is both slightly exasperating and extremely enlightening. It has made me realise language is a delightfully quirky part of culture, and I appreciate the diversity of communication that fills my life every day. It has made me respect and admire cultures, and made me sensitive to social nuances in an exceptional way.  \\\\\\\\The effects of my Indian upbringing also brim over to my experiences outside of home. Once, on Racial Harmony Day, I donned a traditional Indian salwar kameez and a bindi. My classmate asked what the dot on my forehead meant. It was not meant to be offensive, but I remember being taken aback. The bindi was anything but a mere dot. I recalled the trips my mother, aunts and I took to buy colourful bindis to give as presents to newly wedded women. The bindi was important to me, to my culture. But I could not explain why.\\\\\\\\I took it upon myself to ask my family members: my learned grandmothers, my upbeat aunts and some of my favourite cousins, but I never would have if I had not been questioned. It was a revelation indeed: perspective adds such astonishing complexity to everything. I found out that the bindi is not just cultural in meaning. There is a world of personal, religious and spiritual meaning behind it. From then on, I found myself hungry for multiple perspectives: be it articles about a political party or gossip about the newest relief teacher. \\\\\\\\I subsequently invited that classmate to a Diwali gathering at my house. Just then, my friend overheard us speaking and exclaimed, \"Diwali bojio?!\"\\\\\\\\I grinned at how my world resided in those two words.'"

    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. We saw a few ways to this yesterday, using natural language processing. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: word scores. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is *tf-idf* scores. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
