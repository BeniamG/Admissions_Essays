It was an expression that travelled from my mind to my flitting fingertips almost immediately. The resort was simply the image of serenity and solitude- and which student going through examination stress would not want to be a part of that?\\\\It was only when I got home and slumped on the sofa that I saw the nervous look on my mother's face. Her kohl-rimmed eyes were wide and her vermillion adorned forehead scrunched up as she asked, utterly confused, \"What's bojio?\"\\\\I burst out laughing. Sometimes, I forgot how every day brought around a new culture shock when you lived in a traditional Indian family but grew up in a multiracial community. The Hokkien phrase \"bojio\", literally meaning \"never invite\", is a popular colloquialism in Singapore to teasingly express annoyance at not being invited to something. My brother, who has grown up in Singapore as well, would be familiar with it and probably retort with an impish reply making fun of my miserable situation. My parents, however, were dumbfounded.\\\\It was frustrating when I found it a challenge to explain this Hokkien phrase to my mother. I could tell her the definition, but not the feeling that came with it. So I illustrated it in a different context.\\\\\"Mummy, how would you feel if you found out your best friends went to a cricket match without you?\"\\\\She gasped.  For some Indians, not inviting your best friend to a cricket match is pretty much like not inviting them to your wedding.\\\\These experiences come daily when you speak not just two distinct languages, but a vibrant mix of many. Singlish is one of my favourite things about growing up in Singapore. I use Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and various other dialects regularly, sometimes without even realizing it. And with different languages come unique perspectives. When words like \"sian\", \"lepak\" and \"shiok\" roll off my tongue at home and I have to explain them, it is both slightly exasperating and extremely enlightening. It has made me realise language is a delightfully quirky part of culture, and I appreciate the diversity of communication that fills my life every day. It has made me respect and admire cultures, and made me sensitive to social nuances in an exceptional way.  \\\\The effects of my Indian upbringing also brim over to my experiences outside of home. Once, on Racial Harmony Day, I donned a traditional Indian salwar kameez and a bindi. My classmate asked what the dot on my forehead meant. It was not meant to be offensive, but I remember being taken aback. The bindi was anything but a mere dot. I recalled the trips my mother, aunts and I took to buy colourful bindis to give as presents to newly wedded women. The bindi was important to me, to my culture. But I could not explain why.\\\\I took it upon myself to ask my family members: my learned grandmothers, my upbeat aunts and some of my favourite cousins, but I never would have if I had not been questioned. It was a revelation indeed: perspective adds such astonishing complexity to everything. I found out that the bindi is not just cultural in meaning. There is a world of personal, religious and spiritual meaning behind it. From then on, I found myself hungry for multiple perspectives: be it articles about a political party or gossip about the newest relief teacher. \\\\I subsequently invited that classmate to a Diwali gathering at my house. Just then, my friend overheard us speaking and exclaimed, \"Diwali bojio?!\"\\\\I grinned at how my world resided in those two words.\n"

This is the building block for Topic Modeling and a number of other methods we may want to explore.  There are two ways to do this. We can turn it into a sparse matrix type, which can be used within scikit-learn for further analyses.  We can then turn it into a full documnet term matrix, but this is very memory intensive and might not be a great idea for larger data sets."

    "## 7. Tf-idf scores\n",
    "\n",
    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. We saw a few ways to this yesterday, using natural language processing. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: word scores. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is *tf-idf* scores. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the inverse document frequency is calculated as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "number_of_documents / number_documents_with_term\n",

    "\n",
    "tfidf_word1 = word1_frequency_document1 * (number_of_documents / number_document_with_word1)\n",

    "tfidf_word1 = (word1_frequency_document1 / word_count_document1) * (number_of_documents / number_document_with_word1)\n",
    "\n",

      "Two of my greatest passions in life are sports and business. From childhood I was naturally inclined toward sports: to shoot hoops, play catch, and be involved in competition. On the other hand, my interest in business developed over time from observing my grandfather. My grandpa is considered a legend in Chicago Chinese restaurant history, starting over thirty restaurants throughout the Midwest. His entrepreneurial skills were inspirational, and early in my life Grandpa planted seeds in my mind that someday I would be his successor in the restaurant business. Although the specific dream of taking over the restaurants has faded, working there during my high school years has helped me understand the value of hard work and the benefits of running your own business - especially when it's doing something that you love.  The idea was that business can help you pursue your dreams.\\That idea was also emphasized in a significantly different experience. Last summer my mom started helping out at Full Package Athletics, one of the largest AAU travel basketball companies in the area.  We had become very friendly with the owner because my brothers and I all played on teams at Full Package. However, because of some transition in leadership, my mom volunteered to help run the business aspect of Full Package. While the owner was a great basketball coach and trainer, he was business challenged and didn't understand the importance of utilizing fundamental business principles to run the company. There was no clear plan for the future and no business model to follow. After almost a year trying to assist, my mom eventually parted ways with Full Package. Witnessing and hearing about my mom's experience helped me realize how important it was to understand business.  \\The lessons learned from my grandfather and mother have helped me form my future aspiration to eventually combine my two passions and own an international sports agency that represents the best athletes around the world.\n"

      "Cities are always usually associated with raucous streets, and they never sleep. I just happen to live in a silent corner of city. Everyone in my neighborhood went about his or her life without really disturbing anyone else. I have enjoyed my time living here, but I've felt as though something was calling to me in this silent environment. In, my heart, I felt as though I was about to burst with passion. Once it burst, it would form into something special and unique to call my own. This was the beginning of my journey.\\                   As a young lad, I was very reclusive. I was never keen on opening myself up to others or talking about the things that I enjoyed. I thought I would never be exceptionally good at anything. Every time I returned home, I was a bored. I constantly drew pictures and read books. Even this didn't suffice. One day, when my mother was busy in the kitchen,  I began to ask if lunch was ready. I asked repeatedly asking, much to my mother's annoyance. After turning off the stove, she finally asked me if I wanted to watch something called \"television.\"\\                 I had a puzzled look on my face. \"Television,\" I thought to myself, \"Was it some sort of toy?\" She brought me over to the couch and used a strange device to turn it on. My eyes were completely fixed on the screen as I watched the drama. I was confused, and I asked my mother if the people on the T.V. were actually fighting. She said, \"No, sweetie. They are doing something called 'acting.' \" When I watched it, the characters felt so real. The way they were able to express their emotions captivated me. \\                 From then on, I looked forward to returning home, where I could engage with the T.V. I would mimic the people that I saw in the dramas, from great heroes to the vicious villains. In doing this, I felt something that I'd never experienced before. I could finally let out my inner energy and form it into expression. I practiced this every single chance I got. I used playtime to fully immerse myself. Even my friends and teachers were surprised that I had this sort of potential. I wanted to make people happy with my performances. This gave me hope.\\                By going to a university, I can make my dream into a reality. To be able to share that expressiveness with the world and make others laugh and cry with my performances are my dreams. Universities offer the resources I'll need to fully realize my dreams. In addition, I will be able to join with others who have had that same experience as I once did.  I want to make a difference in this world, and pursuing my artistic development at a university is the way for me to get there.  I'm not afraid of the future anymore. I won't run from anything. This is my choice.                 ?\n"

      "Growing up in Catholic school has been challenging at times; however, I have come to accept its effect on my life as positive. I did not realize when I began kindergarten how much of an influence both my school's faith and the people that surrounded me would have on me throughout elementary, middle, and even high school. \\     Because I went to school with a small group of classmates for nine years, my friendships with my peers grew stronger over time. When I entered high school, most of my classmates joined me at the same school, where we would spend four more years surrounded by each other and learning more about one another. Having close friends around me for so long has taught me to be an open, kind, and confident person. Forming friendships with people with so many unique talents and personalities has taught me to be versatile and open to new experiences and opportunities. My friends have also positively affected my work in school, because they encouraged me to take challenging classes and strive for good grades. I was motivated by them to continuously set high academic goals and standards for myself.\\     Furthermore, growing up surrounded by people of the same faith has also held a tremendous influence on my life. Activities such as participating in morning prayer, attending mass at school once a month, and going on retreats have strengthened my faith as well as my friendships. During my senior retreat, I came to realize just how important my place in Catholic school has been. I realized that I see God the most in the people around me. I was inspired and encouraged to look for God not only in myself, but also in my friends. I now have a strong foundation of faith, and I will carry my values with me in college as well as continue to seek God in others. I realized that throughout my years in school, my friendships had allowed me to not only become comfortable with being myself, but they also allowed me to grow into a person of both faith and compassion for others. \\     I view both my lasting friendships as well as my faith as accomplishments that have been supported through my education in Catholic school for the past thirteen years of my life. My small school community taught me the importance of forming strong, reliable bonds with people who will support me during hard times in my life as well as encourage me to excel academically and spiritually. I aspire to continue to grow in my faith as well as make friendships as strong as the ones I have made in Catholic school. My new goal is to find the same form of a support system at a UC. I hope to surround myself once again with people who accept me as well as encourage me to challenge myself in academics of higher education and extracurricular activities. While I will be within a larger community setting, I accept the challenge of finding new people to surround myself with, learn from, and grow with.\n"

      "I lived in a small blue house on the corner of Ceres and Modesto. The house, which comfortably houses five people was jam-packed with eight: my mother and father, my three sisters and my two brothers. Since the house was so full, my parents told stories that seemed to gather the family around and quiet down the never ending chaos that came with a eight person family. \\    I never had a dull moment with my family. My dad is a man who would remember every moment in his life and would always retell these moments as stories. Some of the stories are just retelling the adventures of his daily life, while some stories that are told in the house define who we are as a family. There were many stories of successes like my brother's 4.8 GPA or the many students from the Lo family that crosses the graduation stage as valedictorians.  There are also stories that tell about the failures of my family, like the brother who failed so many classes he was forced to change his major or the little sister who couldn't even do fourth grade math. The stories told by my parents, whether they told of successes or failures, always ended with an overwhelming ambition that things can get even better. It is through these stories that I have learned that I am not defined by my current status or position and that I can change for the better. \\    My family is not comprised of geniuses nor are they complete fools. But I have learned from them that I could become anything whether it be a genius or a fool. And I strive to become a story of success so my dad could also tell stories about me. And maybe I could outshine the past successes, put down the failures, and create a stronger representation of my family and create the person I have always dreamed to be.\n"

      "Voices were chattering and people crowded around in the brightly lit room. Sitting on a swivel chair in the underground cavern, I was surrounded by the sound of laughter and clacking keyboards. I live here--in the computer lab. I've been living here since ninth grade. \\The computer lab was where I was first welcomed with open arms to the coding community. I met friends and mentors who taught me and shared my enthusiasm. They encouraged me to delve into the exciting world of computer science. My curiosity for programming grew as I discovered the fascinating computing specializations of artificial intelligence and graphics. As my programming skills developed, I began work on programming projects with others which further pushed me to grow. Armed with just lines of codes and my trusty keyboard, I ventured deeper into the limitless world of computer science.\\On Friday nights, my friends and I played through the game we made, jumping over enemies and avoiding spike traps. Ever since I discovered programming, I quickly realized that it was able to scratch both my itch for problem-solving and for creation. It provided an endless cycle of creating and debugging. I was hooked. Through coding, my ideas and dreams could become reality. Games I had only imagined, came to life on the screen. As I became intrigued by the use of computer science as a problem solving tool, I began to study the real-world applications of computer science in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. After creating an AI program that could play tic-tac-toe, I was ecstatic. Sitting across the screen from the AI, I had never been happier with losing a game to my own creation. I continued with creating a program to predict housing prices and even created a basic spam filter. \\By being a part of the programming community, I have realized how much it has changed my life. The fellow coders around me push me to become a better programmer and they keep me motivated. Because of the world of programming my friends shared with me, I want to give back to the community. These past few years, I have been sharing my love of coding in order to help others realize their dreams just as I have. During the summer of my sophomore year, I taught kids how to program and build computers at a coding summer camp. Through my work, I gave the kids a community where they can share their enthusiasm and grow as programmers. Furthermore, I founded a coding club at my school in order to provide a group that can collaborate so that we can create bigger and better programs that we couldn't have done as individuals. In the future, I hope to continue inspiring others to not only learn how to program, but also how to enjoy the art of programming.\\?During my senior year, I saw a few shy freshman hovering near the entrance of the computer lab. I grinned and waved them over: \"Welcome to the club\".\n"
